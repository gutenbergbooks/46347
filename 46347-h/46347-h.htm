<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>In these sketches of some of the leading public men of our times,
the editor professes to give such particulars of their lives, and such
only, as the public have a right to know.</p>

<p>Every such man has two lives, his public and his private one.
The one becomes fairly the property of the public, in virtue of his
having been connected with events in which every one has a share
of interest; but the other belongs exclusively to himself, his family,
and his intimate friends, and the public have no more right to discuss
or pry into its details than they have into those of any other private
individual.</p>

<p>The editor has aimed to avoid all privacies and personalities which
might be indelicate in relation to family circles. She has indeed, in
regard to all the characters, so far as possible, dwelt upon the
early family and community influences by which they were formed,
particularly upon the character and influence of mothers; but such
inquiries relate for the most part to those long dead, and whose mortal
history has become a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Whenever the means have been at hand, the family stock from
which each man has been derived, has been minutely traced. The
question of inherited traits is becoming yearly one of increasing interest,
and most striking results come from a comparison of facts
upon this subject. The fusion of different races is said to produce
marked results on the characteristics of the human being. America
has been a great smelting furnace in which tribes and nations have
been melted together, and the result ought to be some new developments
of human nature. It will always be both interesting and
useful to know both the quality of the family stock, and the circumstances
of the early training of men who have acted any remarkable
part in life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
Our country has recently passed through a great crisis which has
concentrated upon it for a time the attention of the civilized world.
It has sustained a shock which the whole world, judging by past
experience, said must inevitably shatter the republic to fragments,
and yet, like a gallant ship in full sail, it has run down the terrible
obstacle, and gone on triumphant, and is this day stronger for the
collision.</p>

<p>This wonderful success is owing to the character of the people
which a Christian Democracy breeds. Of this people we propose to
give a specimen; to show how they were formed in early life, from
the influences which are inherent in such a state.</p>

<p>We are proud and happy to know that these names on our list are
after all but <i>specimens</i>. Probably every reader of this book will
recall as many more whom he will deem equally worthy of public
notice. There is scarcely one of them who would not say in reference
to his position before the public, what Lincoln said: "I stand
where I do because some man must stand there, but there are twenty
others that might as well have been leaders as myself." On the
whole, we are not ashamed to present to the world this list of men
as a specimen of the graduates from the American school of Christian
Democracy.</p>

<p>So far as we know, the American government is the only permanent
republic which ever based itself upon the principles laid down
by Jesus Christ, of the absolute equal brotherhood of man, and the
rights of man on the simple ground of manhood. Notwithstanding
the contrary practices of a section of the States united in the Union,
and the concessions which they introduced into the constitution, nobody
doubts that this was the leading idea of the men who founded
our government. The declaration of American Independence crystalized
a religious teaching within a political act. The constitution
of the United States still further elaborates these principles, and so
strong was the logic of ideas that the conflict of opinions implied in
the incidental concessions to opposite ideas, produced in the government
of the country a continual and irrepressible discord. For a
while it seemed doubtful which idea would triumph, and whether the
accidental parasite would not strangle and wither the great original
tree. The late war was the outcome of the whole. The fierce fire
into which our national character has been cast in the hour of trial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
has burned out of it the last lingering stain of compromise with anything
inconsistent with its primary object, "to ordain justice and
perpetuate liberty."</p>

<p>These men have all been formed by the principles of that great
Christian document, and that state of society and those social influences
which grew out of it, and it is instructive to watch, in their
early life, how a Christian republic trains her sons.</p>

<p>In looking through the list it will be seen that almost every one
of these men sprang from a condition of hard-working poverty. The
majority of them were self-educated men, who in early life were
inured to industrious toil. The farm life of America has been the
nursery of great men, and there is scarce a man mentioned in the
book who has not hardened his muscles and strengthened his brain
power by a hand to hand wrestle with the forces of nature in agricultural
life. Frugality, strict temperance, self-reliance and indomitable
industry have been the lessons of their early days.</p>

<p>Some facts about these specimen citizens are worthy of attention.
More than one-half of them were born and received their early training
in New England, and full one-third are direct lineal descendants
of the Pilgrim fathers. All, so far as we know, are undoubted believers
in the Christian religion&mdash;the greater proportion of them are
men of peculiarly and strongly religious natures, who have been
active and efficient in every peculiarly religious work. All have been
agreed in one belief, that the teachings of Jesus Christ are to be carried
out in political institutions, and that the form of society based
on his teachings, is to be defended at any sacrifice and at all risks.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a political man upon this list whose early efforts
were not menaced with loss and reproach and utter failure, if he
advocated these principles in the conduct of political affairs. For
these principles they have temporarily suffered buffetings, oppressions,
losses, persecutions, and in one great instance, <span class="smcap">Death</span>. All of
them honored liberty when she was hard beset, insulted and traduced,
and it is fit that a free people should honor them in the hour of her
victory.</p>

<p>It will be found when the sum of all these biographies is added up
that the qualities which have won this great physical and moral victory
have not been so much exceptional gifts of genius or culture, as
those more attainable ones which belong to man's moral nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
Taken as a class, while there is a fair proportion both of genius
and scholarship among them, yet the general result speaks more of
average talent and education turned to excellent account, than of any
striking eminence in any particular direction.</p>

<p>But we regard it as highest of all that they were men of good and
honest hearts&mdash;men who have set their faces as a flint to know and
do the <span class="smcap smaller">RIGHT</span>. All of them are men whose principles have been
tried in the fire, men who have braved opposition and persecution
and loss for the sake of what they believed to be true, and knew to
be right, and for this even more than for their bravery in facing danger,
and their patience and perseverance in overcoming difficulties,
we have good hope in offering them as examples to the young men
of America.</p>

<p>In respect to one of the names on the list, the editor's near relationship,
while it gives her most authentic access to all sources of just
information, may be held to require an apology. But the fashion of
writing biographies of our leading men is becoming so popular that
the only way in which a prominent man can protect himself from
being put before the public by any hands who may think fit to assume
the task, is to put into the hands of some friend such authentic particulars
as may with propriety be recorded. Mr. Beecher has recently
been much embarrassed by the solicitation of parties, who notwithstanding
his remonstrances, announce an intention of writing his
life. He has been informed by them that it was to be done whether
he consented or not, and that his only choice was between furnishing
these parties with material, or taking the risk of what they might
discover in their unassisted researches.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, it is hoped that the sketch presented in this volume,
as being undeniably authentic, may so satisfy the demand, that
there may be no call for any other record.</p>

<p>Our times have been marked from all other times
as the scene of an immense conflict which has not
only shaken to its foundation our own country, but
has been felt like the throes of an earthquake through
all the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>Our own days have witnessed the closing of the
great battle, but the preparations for that battle have
been the slow work of years.</p>

<p>The "Men of Our Times," are the men who indirectly
by their moral influence helped to bring on this
great final crisis, and also those who, when it was
brought on, and the battle was set in array, guided it
wisely, and helped to bring it to its triumphant close.</p>

<p>In making our selection we find men of widely different
spheres and characters. Pure philanthropists,
who, ignoring all selfish and worldly politics, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
labored against oppression and wrong; far-seeing
statesmen, who could foresee the working of political
causes from distant years; brave naval and military
men, educated in the schools of our country; scientific
men, who helped to perfect the material forces of war
by their discoveries and ingenuity&mdash;all are united in
one great crisis, and have had their share in one wonderful
passage of the world's history.</p>

<p>Foremost on the roll of "men of our time," it is
but right and fitting that we place the honored and
venerated name of the man who was called by God's
providence to be the leader of the nation in our late
great struggle, and to seal with his blood the proclamation
of universal liberty in this country&mdash;the name
of</p>

<p class="center large">ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>

<p>The revolution through which the American nation
has been passing was not a mere local convulsion. It
was a war for a principle which concerns all mankind.
It was the war for the rights of the working class of
society as against the usurpation of privileged aristocracies.
You can make nothing else of it. That is
the reason why, like a shaft of light in the judgment
day, it has gone through all nations, dividing the multitudes
to the right and the left. <i>For</i> us and our
cause, all the common working classes of Europe&mdash;all
that toil and sweat, and are oppressed. <i>Against</i> us,
all privileged classes, nobles, princes, bankers and
great manufacturers, all who live at ease. A silent
instinct, piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit,
joints and marrow, has gone through the earth, and
sent every soul with instinctive certainty where it belongs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
The poor laborers of Birmingham and Manchester,
the poor silk weavers of Lyons, to whom our
conflict has been present starvation and lingering
death, have stood bravely <i>for</i> us. No sophistries
could blind or deceive <i>them</i>; they knew that <i>our</i> cause
was <i>their</i> cause, and they suffered their part heroically,
as if fighting by our side, because they knew that our
victory was to be their victory. On the other side,
all aristocrats and holders of exclusive privileges have
felt the instinct of opposition, and the sympathy with
a struggling aristocracy, for they, too, felt that our
victory would be their doom.</p>

<p>This great contest has visibly been held in the hands
of Almighty God, and is a fulfillment of the solemn
prophecies with which the Bible is sown thick as stars,
that He would spare the soul of the needy, and judge
the cause of the poor. It was He who chose the instrument
for this work, and He chose him with a visible
reference to the rights and interests of the great
majority of mankind, for which he stood.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln was in the strictest sense <i>a man
of the working classes</i>. All his advantages and abilities
were those of a man of the working classes, all
his disadvantages and disabilities those of the working
classes, and his position at the head of one of the most
powerful nations of the earth was a sign to all who
live by labor, that their day is coming. Lincoln was
born to the inheritance of hard work, as truly as the
poorest laborer's son that digs in our fields. He was
born in Kentucky, in 1809. At seven years of age he
was set to work, axe in hand, to clear up a farm in a
Western forest. Until he was seventeen his life was
that of a simple farm laborer, with only such intervals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
of schooling as farm laborers get. Probably the school
instruction of his whole life would not amount to more
than six months. At nineteen he made a trip to New
Orleans as a hired hand on a flat-boat, and on his return
he split the timber for a log cabin and built it, and
enclosed ten acres of land with a rail fence of his own
handiwork. The next year he hired himself for
twelve dollars a month to build a flat-boat and take
her to New Orleans, and any one who knows what
the life of a Mississippi boatman was in those days,
must know that it involved every kind of labor. In
1832, in the Black Hawk Indian war, the hardy boatman
volunteered to fight for his country, and was unanimously
elected a captain, and served with honor for a
season in frontier military life. He was very popular
with his soldiers for two reasons; the first was his great
physical strength; the second, that he could tell more
and better stories than any other man in the army.
Odd constituents for a commander's character; but
like everything else in Lincoln's life, the fact shows
how wonderfully he represented, and therefore suited,
the people. Some time after the war, the surveyor
of Sangamon county, being driven with work, came
to him to take the survey of a tract off from his hands.
True, he had never studied surveying, but what of
that? He accepted the job, procured a chain and a
treatise on surveying, and <i>did the work</i>. Do we not
see in this a parallel of the wider wilderness which in
later years he was to undertake to survey and fit for
human habitation, <i>without</i> chart or surveyor's chain?</p>

<p>After this, while serving as a postmaster, he began
his law studies. He took the postmastership for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
sake of reading all the papers that came into the town,
at the same time borrowing the law books he was too
poor to buy, and studying by the light of his evening
fire. He soon acquired a name in the country about as
a man of resources and shrewdness. He was one that
people looked to for counsel in exigencies, and to
whom they were ready to depute almost any enterprise
which needed skill and energy, or patience and
justice. "He was in great request," says one of his
biographers, "by thick-headed people, because of his
clearness and skill in narration." It might well have
been added, because also of his kindness, patience and
perfect justness of nature in listening, apprehending
and stating.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln was now about twenty-three. His life
thus far may perhaps be considered as his education;
at any rate, it is the part of his life which answers to
the school years, college course, and professional studies
of a regularly educated lawyer at the East. It
included, of actual "schooling," only the six months
total already mentioned. Even then it was his mother
who had taught him to read and write. Of the use of
books of any kind, this backwoods graduate had little
enough. His course of reading was a very thorough
illustration of the ancient rule to "read not many but
much." He read seven books over and over. Of
three of them, the Bible, Shakspeare and Æsop's Fables,
he could repeat large portions by heart. The
other four were the Pilgrim's Progress, the Life of
Washington, the Life of Franklin, and the Life of
Henry Clay. It is a curious fact that neither then nor
afterwards did he ever read a novel. He began Ivanhoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
once, but was not interested enough to finish it.
He was one of those men who have the peculiar faculty
of viewing this whole world of men and things
as a side spectator, and the interest of the drama of
life thus silently seen at first hand, was to him infinitely
more interesting than any second hand imitation.
"My life is story enough," once said a person of this
peculiar temperament, "what should I want to read
stories for?" The interest he felt in human beings
was infinitely stronger with him than the interest in
artistic representation.</p>

<p>One of his biographers says that he "seldom bought
a new book, and seldom read one," and he adds, with
a good deal of truth, that "his education was almost
entirely a newspaper one," and that he "was one of
the most thorough newspaper readers in America."</p>

<p>But that which was much more the real essence of
his self-education, was the never-ceasing and strenuous
course of laborious thought and reasoning that he
kept up, upon the meaning, the connection, the tendency,
the right and wrong, the helps or remedies, of
all the past facts he read of, or of the present facts
that he experienced in life. And this education he
not only began early and pursued effectively, but he
never ceased it. All his life he maintained that course
of steady labor after practical knowledge and practical
wisdom. Whenever he could read a good book
he did, and his practice for a long time was, after having
finished it, to write out an analysis of it; a very
fatiguing but very improving process. One of his
companions while a young "hired man," described
him in after years, as "the likeliest boy in God's world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
He would work all day as hard as any of us, and study
by fire-light in the log house half the night, and in this
way he made himself a thorough practical surveyor."
Another man described him as he saw him while working
for a living, in 1830, or thereabouts, "lying on a
trundle-bed, with one leg stretched out rocking the cradle
containing the child of his hostess, while he himself
was absorbed in the study of English grammar."</p>

<p>The world has many losses that mankind are not
conscious of. The burning of the Alexandrian library
was an irreparable loss, but a greater loss is in the silence
of great and peculiar minds. Had there been
any record of what Lincoln thought and said while he
thus hewed his way through the pedantic mazes of
book learning, we might have some of the newest, the
strangest, the most original contributions to the philosophy
of grammar and human language in general
that ever have been given. They would have savored
very much of Beethoven's answer when the critics
asked him why he would use consecutive octaves in
music. "Because they sounded well," said the scornful
old autocrat; and Lincoln's quiet perseverance in a
style of using the English language peculiarly his own
had something of the same pertinacity. He seemed
equally amused by the critical rules of rhetoric, and
as benevolently and paternally indulgent to the mass
of eager scholars who thought them important, as he
was to the turbulent baby whom he rocked with one
leg while he pursued his grammatical studies. But
after his own quaint, silent fashion, he kept up his inquiries
into the world of book learning with remarkable
perseverance, and his friend and biographer, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Arnold, says, became "thoroughly at home in all the
liberal studies and scientific questions of the day."
This is rather strongly put, and we fancy that Lincoln
would have smiled shrewdly over it, but the specifications
which Mr. Arnold adds are undoubtedly true.
Mr. Lincoln "had mastered English, and made some
progress in Latin, and knew the Bible more thoroughly
than many who have spent their lives in its perusal."</p>

<p>But what book learning he obtained would never
have made him a lawyer, not to say President. The
education which gave him his success in life was his
self-training in the ability to understand and to state
facts and principles about men and things.</p>

<p>In 1836 our backwoodsman, flat-boat hand, captain,
surveyor, obtained a license to practice law, and as
might be expected, rose rapidly. One anecdote will
show the esteem in which he was held in his neighborhood.
A client came to him in a case relating to
a certain land claim, and Lincoln said to him, "Your
first step must be to take thirty thousand dollars and
go and make a legal tender; it of course will be refused,
but it is a necessary step." "But," said the
man, "I haven't the thirty thousand dollars to make
it with." "O, that's it; just step over to the bank
with me, and I'll get it." So into the bank they went,
and Lincoln says to the cashier, "We just want to
take thirty thousand dollars to make a legal tender
with; I'll bring it back in an hour or two." The
cashier handed across the money to "Honest Abe,"
and without a scratch of the pen in acknowledgment,
he strode his way with the money, all in the most sacred
simplicity, made the tender, and brought it back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
with as much nonchalance as if he had been borrowing
a silver spoon of his grandmother.</p>

<p>It was after he had been practicing law some time,
that another incident took place, showing him as curiously
scrupulous about small sums as he was trusty
and trusted about large ones. When he left New Salem
and went to Springfield, he was still so poor that
he even found it difficult to procure the necessaries of
life. For some years he struggled forward, when one
day there came a post-office agent, who in pursuance
of the routine business of the department, presented
to the almost penniless and still struggling ex-postmaster
a regulation draft for the balance due to the
Washington office, in all $17.60. Dr. Henry, a friend
of Mr. Lincoln's, happening to fall in with the agent,
went along with him, intending to offer to lend the
money, as it was about certain that he could have no
such sum as that at his command. When the draft
was presented, Lincoln asked the officer to be seated,
sat down himself a few moments, looking puzzled;
then asked to be excused for a little, stepped out to
his boarding house and returned. He brought with
him an old stocking, untied it, and poured out on the
table a quantity of small silver coin and "red cents."
These they counted; they amounted to $17.60, the precise
amount called for by the draft. More than that&mdash;it
was <i>the very money</i> called for by the draft, for at leaving
his postmastership, the punctilious officer had tied
up the balance on hand, and kept it by him, awaiting
the legal call for it. At paying it over, he remarked
that he <i>never used, even temporarily, any money that
was not his</i>. This money, he added, he felt belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
to the government, and he had no right to exchange
or use it for any purposes of his own.</p>

<p>His honesty, shrewdness, energy and keen practical
insight into men and things soon made him the most
influential man in his state, both as lawyer and politician.
Of this influence, and most especially of its
depending upon his wonderfully direct plain common
sense, and the absolute honesty and utter justness of
his mind, there are many anecdotes. In politics and
in law alike, both the strength of his conscientiousness
and the kind of yearning after a rounded wholeness
of view which was an intellectual instinct with him,
forced him habitually to consider all sides of any question.
"For fifteen years before his election to the
Presidency," says one writer, in striking illustration of
this habit in politics, "he subscribed regularly to
<i>The Richmond Enquirer</i> and <i>The Charleston Mercury</i>.
He grew slowly, as public opinion grew; and as an
anti-slavery man, was a gradual convert." Thus it resulted
that "while Rhett and Wise, with slavery in
full feather, wrote every day the inviolateness of secession
and the divinity of bondage, these two Illinois
lawyers, (Lincoln and his partner, Herndon,) in their
little square office, read every vaunting cruel word,
paid to read it, and educated themselves out of their
mutual indignations."</p>

<p>In like manner he was fair and impartial in legal
investigations. "The jury" says one account, "always
got from him a fair statement of any case in hand,
and years later it was remarked by the Chief Justice
of Illinois that when Lincoln spoke, he argued both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
sides of the case so well that a speech in response was
always superfluous."</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln's fellow lawyers used to say that he was
in professional matters, "perversely honest." He
could not take hold heartily on the wrong side. He
never engaged in it, knowingly; if a man desired to retain
him whose cause was bad, he declined, and told the
applicant not to go to law. A lady once came to him
to have him prosecute a claim to some land, and gave
him the papers in the case for examination, together
with a retainer in the shape of a check for two hundred
dollars. Next day she came to see what her
prospects were, when Mr. Lincoln told her that he had
examined the documents very carefully, that she "had
not a peg to hang her claim on," and that he could
not conscientiously advise her to bring an action.
Having heard this judgment, the lady thanked him,
took her papers, and was about to depart. "Wait a
moment," said Mr. Lincoln, "here is the check you gave
me." "But," said she, "Mr. Lincoln, I think you have
earned <i>that</i>." "No, no," he answered, insisting on
her receiving it, "that would not be right. I can't
take pay for doing my duty."</p>

<p>He was quite as prompt and just in accepting unprofitable
duty as in declining its profitable opposite.
During all the early part of his legal practice in Springfield,
it was considered an unpopular and politically
dangerous business for a lawyer to defend any fugitive
slave on trial for surrender to the South, and even the
brave Col. Baker, in those days also practicing there,
on one occasion directly refused to defend such a case,
saying that as a political man he could not afford it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
But the luckless applicant, having consulted with an
abolitionist friend, went next to Lincoln, and got
him. "<i>He's</i> not afraid of an unpopular case," said the
friend; "when I go for a lawyer to defend an arrested
fugitive slave, other lawyers will refuse me; but if
Mr. Lincoln is at home, he will always take up my
case."</p>

<p>On a few occasions after having even entered into
the trial of a case, Mr. Lincoln would find that, as
sometimes happens, he had been deceived by his own
client, and that he really had not the right on his side.
When this was the case, he could as it were be seen
to wilt at once, and whatever further he might do in
the case was only mechanical. In such a case, having
an associate, and having refused to argue it, the associate
argued the case <i>and won it</i>, and then offered to
divide with Mr. Lincoln the fee of $900; but Lincoln
would not take a cent. Once in defending a man
sued for delivering lambs instead of sheep, the testimony
clearly showed that such delivery had been
made. Instead of trying to confuse the witnesses or
becloud the evidence, Mr. Lincoln ascertained how
many such lambs had been delivered, and quietly told
the jury that they must give a verdict against his
client. He simply cautioned them to be just in fixing
the damages. When he had recovered a verdict
against a railroad company, and a certain offset against
his client was to be deducted, he interrupted the final
decision just in time to have the offset <i>made larger</i> by
a certain amount which he had just found out ought
to be added to it. His careful and primitive scrupulousness
was just as marked in dealing with any associates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
in a case. When he received a joint fee his invariable
custom was to divide it properly, and tie up in a
separate parcel each associate's part of <i>the very money
received</i>, duly labelled and directed.</p>

<p>In 1841 Mr. Lincoln argued before the Supreme
Court of Illinois, the case of Nance, a negro girl, who
had been sold within the state. A note had been given
in payment for her, and the suit was brought to recover
upon this note. Mr. Lincoln, defending, proved
that Nance was free, and that thus nothing had been
sold; so that the note was void. The Court below
had sustained the note, but the Supreme Court, in
accordance with Mr. Lincoln's argument, reversed this
judgment. The decision made Nance free, and put a
stop to sales of human beings in Illinois.</p>

<p>Another remarkable case in which he was engaged,
was, the defence of young Armstrong from a charge
of murder. This Armstrong was the son of a man
who had befriended and employed Mr. Lincoln in
youth, and the present charge was, that he had killed
a certain person who had unquestionably died from injuries
received in a camp-meeting riot where young
Armstrong was present. The father was dead, and
the mother aged and poor; a chain of apparently perfectly
conclusive circumstantial evidence had been
forged, which had convinced the community of Armstrong's
guilt; indeed, had he not been safely secured
in a strong jail he would have been lynched. Neither
the youth nor his old mother had any money. The
people and the newspapers were furious against the
prisoner; and his fate appeared absolutely certain even
to himself, when Mr. Lincoln, hearing of the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
in some way, volunteered for the defence, and was
gladly accepted. When the trial came on, the evidence
for the prosecution was given, and constituted
what appeared to the audience a perfectly conclusive
proof of guilt. Lincoln cross-examined very lightly,
only correcting up and ascertaining a few places and
dates; and his own witnesses were only to show comparatively
good previous character for the prisoner.</p>

<p>The prosecutor, sure of his prey, made only a short
and formal argument. Mr. Lincoln followed for the
defence. He began slowly, calmly, carefully. He
took hold of the heart of the evidence for the state&mdash;that
of the chief witness. He pointed out first one
discrepancy, and then another, and then another. He
came at last to that part of the evidence where this
principal witness had sworn positively that he had
been enabled by the light of the moon to see the
prisoner give the fatal blow with a slung shot; and
taking up the almanac he showed that at the hour
sworn to on the night sworn to <i>the moon had not risen</i>;
that the whole of this evidence was a perjury.</p>

<p>The audience, gradually stirred and changed in the
temper of their minds by the previous series of skilfully
displayed inconsistencies, rising from hate into
sympathy, flamed suddenly up at this startling revelation,
and the verdict of "not guilty" was almost
visible in the faces of the jury. But this was not all.
Turning upon the infamous man who had sought to
swear away another's life, Mr. Lincoln, now fully kindled
into his peculiarly slow but intensely fiery wrath,
held him up to the view of court and jury and audience,
in such a horrid picture of guilt and shame that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the miserable fellow, stunned and confounded, actually
fled from the face of the incensed lawyer out of
the court room. And in conclusion, Mr. Lincoln appealed
to the jury to lay aside any temporary prejudices,
and to do simple justice. And he referred to
the motive of his own presence there,&mdash;to his gratitude
for the kindness of the prisoner's father in past
years, in a manner so affecting as to bring tears from
many eyes. In less than half an hour the jury returned
a verdict of not guilty, and the young man
was set free, his life saved and his character restored.</p>

<p>When he went for the second time into public life,
on the passage of the Nebraska Bill in 1854, he was
becoming eminent in the difficult and lucrative department
of patent law. But his fellow lawyers used
to call his fees "ridiculously small." Indeed, he never
took but one large fee, and that his friends insisted on
his taking. This was $5,000 from the Illinois Central
Railroad Company, one of the richest corporations in
the country, and for very valuable services in a very
important case. Once before this he had received
what he thought a large fee, and he made a good use
of it. The sum was five hundred dollars, and a friend
who called to see him the next morning, found him
counting it over and over, and piling it up on the table
to look at. "Look here," he said, "see what a heap of
money I've got from the &mdash;&mdash; case! Did you ever
see anything like it! Why, I never had so much
money in my life before, put it all together!" Then
he added, that if he could only get another $250 to
put with it, he would at once buy a quarter-section of
land, and settle it on his old step-mother. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
an odd use to make of a man's first important gains
in money, and his friend, who at once loaned him the
required additional amount, tried to make him give
the land for the old lady's life only. But Lincoln insisted
on his own plan, saying, "I shall do no such
thing. It is a poor return at the best, for all the good
woman's devotion and fidelity to me, and there isn't
going to be any half-way work about it."</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln was a great favorite at the bar, his good
nature, his kindness, and his unfailing flow of stories,
making him a most welcome guest on every circuit.</p>

<p>He never took technical advantages, but on the
other hand often showed an adversary some error in
matter of form, and suggested to him how to cure it.
His forensic habits were excessively simple, but very
effective. The most telling of all of them was <i>to be
in the right</i>; for when juries know that a lawyer habitually
refuses to be on the wrong side, habitually
breaks down if on that side, simply from consciousness
of the fact, and habitually makes strong and clear
arguments if on the right side, they are prepossessed
in favor of that lawyer before he says a word. He
did not make speeches to the jury, he talked with
them; often in warm weather taking off his coat for
coolness, selecting some intelligent looking juryman,
reasoning with him until convinced, then taking
another, and so on. He did not browbeat witnesses, but
kept them comfortable and good humored. In short,
Mr. Lincoln was decidedly and deservedly a powerful
as well as a successful lawyer. He must have been of
great professional powers to maintain himself, and rise
to the leadership of the bar, with the competitors he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
had. Among these were Mr. Douglas, Secretary
Browning, Senator Trumbull, Governor Yates, Judge
Davis of the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court, Col. Baker, Gen.
Hardin, Gov. Bissell, Gen. Shields, Senator Washburn,
N.&nbsp;B. Judd, Gen. Logan, and others. He became recognized
by his fellow-citizens as "the first lawyer in Illinois,"
and one of the judges on the bench described
him as "the finest lawyer he ever knew," and another
as "one of the ablest he had ever known."</p>

<p>Like so many of his profession, Mr. Lincoln was
very early a politician. Indeed, his devotion to politics
interfered very considerably with his gains, and
delayed his eminence in his profession. The value to
his fellow-countrymen of the political results which he
was the means of bringing to pass, is, however, so infinitely
beyond any money value, that no regret can
be felt at his ambition.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln's popularity among his neighbors, his
assiduous study of the newspapers, his intense and
untiring meditations and reasonings on the political
questions of the day, brought him into the political
field pretty early and pretty well prepared. It was
in 1832, when he was twenty-three years old, that his
first candidacy and his first speech took place. The
story and speech all together are so short that they
can be inserted here in full. On the day of election,
then, Mr. Lincoln's opponent spoke first, and delivered
a long harangue of the regular political sort. Lincoln,
who followed him, completed his oration in just
seventy-nine words&mdash;less than one minute's talking.
This is what he said: "Gentlemen, fellow citizens:&mdash;I
presume you know who I am; I am humble Abraham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Lincoln. I have been solicited by many friends
to become a candidate for the Legislature. My politics
can be briefly stated. I am in favor of a national
bank, I am in favor of the internal improvement system,
and a high protective tariff. These are my sentiments
and political principles. If elected I shall be
thankful, if not, it will be all the same."</p>

<p>He was beaten, however, in spite of his terseness.
But in his own district he received all but seven out
of 284 votes; and he was never beaten again in any
election by the people.</p>

<p>His actual political career, not counting this defeat,
began in 1834, when he was chosen member of the
State Legislature, and being too poor to afford a horse,
<i>walked</i> over a hundred miles to Vandalia to take his
seat. He remained a member for four successive
terms of two years each. Mr. Douglas became a
member two years after him, in 1836; the two men
quickly became party leaders on their respective sides
of the house, and thus their political courses and their
political rivalries began almost together. At the
two latter of his four legislative terms, Mr. Lincoln
was the Whig candidate for Speaker, and once lacked
only one vote of being elected. Mr. Lincoln's eight
years' service in the State Legislature was busy and
useful, and gave him an assured and high position in
his party. The work done was usually of a local
character, of course, its most important departments
being that of the improvement of internal communication
by railroad and canal, and that of education.</p>

<p>But even on the question of slavery, the one significant
occasion for utterance which arose was promptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
improved, and in such a manner as to show both the
settled feelings and convictions of Lincoln's mind on
the subject, and his characteristic practice of restricting
his official utterances strictly to the exigencies of
the case. His dislike of slavery was not only the consequence
of his inborn sense of justice and kindly
feelings, but was his direct inheritance from his parents,
who left Kentucky and settled in Indiana expressly
to bring up their family on free instead of
slave soil. In March, 1839, some strong pro-slavery
resolutions were passed by the Legislature of Illinois,
and by large majorities in both houses. This, the few
anti-slavery members could not prevent. But Mr.
Lincoln and Mr. Dan Stone took the most decided
stand in their power on the other side, by putting on
record on the House journals a formal protest against
the resolutions. In this protest, they declared views
that would to-day be considered very conservative,
about legal or political interference with slavery; but
they also declared in the most unqualified manner, and
in so many words, their belief "that the institution of
slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy."</p>

<p>At the end of his fourth term, Mr. Lincoln declined
a further nomination, finding it absolutely necessary
to devote more time than hitherto to his own private
affairs. When he thus left the Legislature of his own
accord, he was virtually the leader of his party in the
State, having reached that creditable and influential
though unofficial position by his own good qualities,
in the eight years of his life ending with his thirty-fifth.
It was a great achievement for a man no older,
and so destitute of outside help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
For four years Mr. Lincoln now remained a hard-working
lawyer, although he did a good deal of political
work besides, particularly in "stumping" Illinois
and Indiana in the Presidential canvass of 1844. In
this campaign Mr. Lincoln made many strong and effective
speeches for Henry Clay, and though his candidate
was beaten, his own reputation as a politician
and speaker was much increased. In 1846 he was
elected to Congress as a Whig, and his extreme popularity
at home is shown by the fact that his own majority
on this occasion was 1,511 in the Springfield
district, while Mr. Clay's had been only 914.</p>

<p>During this congressional term, Mr. Lincoln met the
grinding of the great question of the day&mdash;the upper
and nether millstone of slavery and freedom revolving
against each other. Lincoln's whole nature inclined
him to be a harmonizer of conflicting parties, rather
than a committed combatant on either side. He was
firmly and from principle an enemy to slavery, but the
ground he occupied in Congress was in some respects
a middle one between the advance guard of the anti-slavery
army and the spears of the fire-eaters. He
voted with John Quincy Adams for the receipt of
anti-slavery petitions; he voted with Giddings for a
committee of inquiry into the constitutionality of
slavery in the District of Columbia, and the expediency
of abolishing slavery in that district; he voted
for the various resolutions prohibiting slavery in the
territories to be acquired from Mexico, and he voted
forty-two times for the Wilmot Proviso. On one occasion,
he offered a plan for abolishing slavery in the
District of Columbia, by compensation from the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
treasury, with the consent of a majority of the
citizens. He opposed the annexation of Texas, but
voted for the bill to pay the expenses of the war. He
voted against paying for slaves as property, when that
question came up in the celebrated Pacheco case, and
thus recorded his denial of the right of owning men,
or of its acknowledgment by the nation.</p>

<p>During this term of service in Congress, Mr. Lincoln
was a laborious and faithful public servant; always
present to vote, and always ready for business; and
his speeches, homely and rough as they were, showed
so much broad strong sense, natural rectitude, sincerity,
and power of reasoning, as to give him a good position
as a debater. He declined a re-election; tried for but
did not obtain the commissionership of the Land Office
at Washington; declined appointments as Secretary
and as Governor of Oregon Territory; returned to
his home and his work; was unsuccessful as candidate
for the United States Senate in the Illinois Legislature
of 1849&ndash;50; and labored industriously at his profession,
until the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,
the Kansas Nebraska Bill, and the violences and iniquities
connected with them, called him once more
into public life.</p>

<p>He now took the field, heart and soul against the
plot to betray our territories into slavery, and to perpetuate
the power of that institution over the whole
country. Henceforth he was all his life a public man;
first a prominent champion in the decisively important
state of Illinois, and afterwards the standard bearer
and the martyr of Freedom in America.</p>

<p>That contest in Illinois, in which the political doctrines
of Mr. Douglas were the central theme of discussion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
and in which he himself on one side and Mr.
Lincoln on the other, were the leading speakers and
the controlling minds, was an important act in that
great drama of emancipation which culminated in the
Rebellion. In Mr. Lincoln's life it was if possible
still greater in comparative importance; for his debates
with Douglas determined his reputation as a
speaker and a public man, and lifted him to the position
from which he stepped into the presidential chair.</p>

<p>During other previous and subsequent portions of
his life, other traits of Mr. Lincoln's character were
often and clearly exemplified. But at no time was he
nearly as plainly and strikingly prominent as a power,
as during his contest with that bold and energetic politician
and remarkably ready and forcible debater,
Stephen A. Douglas.</p>

<p>Their first great public duel, as it may be called, was
at Springfield, in October, 1854, just after the passage
of the Nebraska bill. The country was all aflame with
excitement. Every fibre of justice, honor, honesty,
conscience that there was in the community was in
that smarting and vibrating state which follows the
infliction of a violent blow, and Douglas had come
back to his own state to soothe down the irritation
and to defend his wicked and unpopular course before
the aroused tribunal of his fellow citizens.</p>

<p>He was to defend his course and conduct to a great
audience assembled at the State fair, and Mr. Lincoln
was to answer him.</p>

<p>Never was there a greater contrast between two men.
Douglas might be called a brilliant impersonation of
all the mere worldly forces of human nature. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
had a splendid physique, with all the powers of the
most captivating oratory, the melody of a most astonishing
voice which ran with ease through every gamut
of human feeling, grave, gay, pathetic, passionate, enthusiastic;
now rising with irresistible impetuosity, now
mocking with gay and careless defiance, and with this
voice and this person, he was master of all those shadings
and delicacies of sophistry by which the worse
can be made to appear the better reason. He knew
well how to avoid answering a telling argument by a
dazzling glitter of side issues&mdash;to make a plain man
believe he had got his difficulty solved, when he had
been only skilfully bewitched, and made to forget
where it was. In a popular audience he had something
for every one. Gaiety, gallantry and compliments
for ladies, assured confidence for doubters, vehement
assertions for timid people, stormy brow-beatings,
and lion roars of denunciation, to finish with a
grand sweep the popular impression which his sophistries
and assertions had begun. Of truth, he made
that very sparing use which demagogues always do. A
little blue line of steel makes a whole heavy headed
iron axe go through the wood,&mdash;and so Douglas just
skilfully and artistically tipped the edges of heavy
masses of falsehood with the cutting force of some
undeniable truth.</p>

<p>Of moral sensibility Douglas had not enough in his
nature, even to understand that kind of material in
others, and to make allowance for it. Nothing could
be more exactly the contrary of Lincoln's scrupulous
careful self-education, in pure questions of the right and
the wrong of things, than Douglas' glittering, careless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
reckless, defiant mode of treating all these subjects.
Lincoln had trained himself always to ask, What is it
right to do? Douglas, What <i>can</i> I do? Lincoln, to
enquire What course <i>ought</i> they to take? Douglas,
What course can I make them take? Lincoln, to ask,
What is the truth&mdash;Douglas, What can be made to
<i>seem</i> truth. His life question was an inquiry, pure and
simple, how much can I get, how much can I do,
without losing my hold over men and being turned
out of society?</p>

<p>The pure moral aspects of political questions, he
flouted and scoffed at as unworthy the attention of a
practical politician. The rights of human beings, the
eternal laws of rectitude, he treated as a skilful conjurer
treats so many gaily painted balls, which he
throws up and tosses and catches, simply to show his
own agility; he played with them when they came in
his way, just as he thought he could make them most
effective for his own purposes.</p>

<p>But if he did not understand or care for eternal
principles, he was perfect master of all the weak and
low and petty side of human nature. He knew how
to stir up all the common-place, base and ignoble
passions of man; to bring his lower nature into lively
exercise.</p>

<p>The first day in the fair, the multitude was given
up to him, and he swept and played on them as a
master musician sweeps a piano, and for the hour he
seemed to be irresistible, bearing all things in his own
way.</p>

<p>Lincoln had this advantage, when his turn came,
that he represented that higher portion of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
nature, of which Douglas had little knowledge, and
which his mode of treatment had left almost wholly
untouched. We have spoken of the vast legal influence
which Lincoln had gradually acquired in his own
state, by the intense pertinacity with which he identified
himself in every case with right and justice, so that
the mere fact that he had accepted a cause was a
strong reason in advance for believing it the true one.</p>

<p>The people had been excited, amused, dazzled and
bewildered, and were tossing restlessly as the sea swells
and dashes after a gale&mdash;when that plain man without
outward "form or comeliness," without dazzle of oratory,
or glitter of rhetoric, rose to give them in a
fatherly talk, the simple eternal <span class="smcap smaller">RIGHT</span> of the whole
thing.</p>

<p>It was, he felt, an hour of destiny, a crisis in the great
battle to be fought for mankind for ages to come, and
an eye witness thus describes the scene: "His whole
heart was in the subject. He quivered with feeling
and emotion; the house was as still as death." And
another account describes how "the effect of this
speech was most magnetic and powerful. Cheer upon
cheer interrupted him, women waved their handkerchiefs,
men sprung from their seats and waved their
hats in uncontrollable enthusiasm." Mr. Douglas was
present at this speech, and was the most uneasy auditor
there. As soon as Mr. Lincoln had concluded,
Mr. Douglas jumped up and said that he had been
abused, "though," he added, "in a perfectly courteous
manner." He went on with a rejoinder, and
spoke for some time, but without much success. In
fact, he was astounded and disconcerted at finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
that there was so much to be said against him, and
that there was a man to say it so powerfully. The self-confident
and even arrogant tone in which he had
opened the debate was gone. At closing, he announced
himself to continue his remarks in the evening,
but he did not do it. He had received a blow
too tremendous even for his immense vigor, and from
which he could not so quickly recover.</p>

<p>A little while afterwards, Douglas spoke again and
Lincoln answered him again, at Peoria, and with a similar
result. The vast positive will of the "Little
Giant" could not stand up against the still loftier
power with which Mr. Lincoln assailed him from the
height of a moral superiority that irresistibly carried
with it the best convictions of the whole community,
and cowed the defiant wrong-doer. Mr. Lincoln was
<i>right</i>. Mr. Douglas felt himself vanquished by a power
incomprehensible to himself, and of which none of
his political calculations ever took account.</p>

<p>But as regards the struggle at this time in Illinois,
the fact that he felt himself over-weighted, was sufficiently
proved by his declining, after the two duels
at Springfield and Peoria, to proceed, as Mr. Lincoln
invited him, with a series of such debates in other
parts of the State.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln, having thus publicly shown himself far
stronger than the strongest of his opponents, proceeded
to show himself a man of kindly self-command, by
foregoing the Republican nomination to the U.&nbsp;S.
Senate, and giving it to Hon. Lyman Trumbull, in
order to save the risk of admitting Matteson, the pro-slavery
candidate. Unquestionably this conduct coincided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
with the shrewdest selfishness; but very few
are the politicians from whom a selfishness small and
near would not conceal the larger and further one.
It was by earnest and assiduous personal influence
that Mr. Lincoln secured Mr. Trumbull's election.</p>

<p>It is said of a certain great diplomatist, that he was
so accustomed to dealing with men as knaves that
when he had to do with an honest man he always blundered.
Douglas' mistake and defeat were precisely
of this kind. He had so little sense of conscience or
moral feeling himself that he was perfectly unprepared
for the uprising of these sentiments on the part of the
people, and astonished at the power which a man
might wield simply from addressing a class of sentiments
which he habitually ignored.</p>

<p>So in Congress, when the petition of the three thousand
clergymen was presented against the Kansas and
Nebraska bill, he was in a perfect rage, and roared like
a lion at bay. That this contemptible question of
right and wrong should get up such an excitement
and seriously threaten such a brilliant stroke of diplomacy
as he meditated, seemed to him, in all sincerity,
perfectly ridiculous&mdash;he could not sufficiently
express his hatred and contempt.</p>

<p>Mere power as a debater, either in parliamentary
assemblies or before popular meetings, has often
existed, without any share of the calmer, and larger,
and profounder, and more reflective abilities of the
statesman. Mr. Lincoln possessed both, and in both,
his methods were alike of an intuitively practical,
and remarkably direct, simple and effective nature.
Doubtless he had often given proofs of skill in practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
politics, during his consultations of the preceding
twenty years, with the leaders and managers of his
party in Illinois. Obscure operations of local party
organizations seldom make any record, or become visible
at all on the surface of history. But the man who
in an adverse hour, when all other counsellors have
failed, can unite discordant elements into a new party,
must be confessed to have statesmanlike skill. This is
more peculiarly so when this party must be founded
on a moral principle, and must be bounded and circumscribed
in its working by moral rules and restraints.
While unprincipled men can help themselves by any
and all sorts of means, men of principle are confined
to those within certain limits, and the difficulties of organization
in such cases are vastly greater.</p>

<p>When in 1856 the Illinois convention met to choose
delegates to the National Convention that nominated
Fremont, there was in the political ocean a wild chaos
of elements. Free Soil men, Anti-Nebraska men,
Liberty Party men, Native Americans, Old Whigs
and Old Democrats, and newly arrived emigrants of
no party at all, mixed up in heterogeneous confusion,
tossing and tumbling blindly about for a new
platform to stand on. After long and vain discussion,
the committee on a platform sent for Mr. Lincoln and
asked for a suggestion. All the sections of the Convention
were opposed to slavery extension, but in no other
current political question were they at one. There
was imminent danger of discord and division. Their
calm adviser quietly said, "Take the Declaration of
Independence, and Hostility to Slavery Extension.
Let us build our new party on the rock of the Declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of Independence, and the gates of hell shall not
prevail against us." Mr. Lincoln's profound and unfailing
moral sense had seized upon the relation between
the heart of the United States and eternal right. His
suggestion embodied the only doctrine that could
have won in the coming battle. What he advised
was done, and the party, on this platform, revolutionized
Illinois, made Mr. Lincoln President, extinguished
slavery, and reorganized the nation.</p>

<p>At Philadelphia, the same question came up again,
and was solved by adopting the same principle. It
was on this occasion that Mr. Lincoln's high position
and important influence in the northwest received the
first acknowledgement that he was obtaining a national
reputation. He obtained a vote of one hundred
and ten for the Vice Presidency on the preliminary
or informal ballot.</p>

<p>The great effort, however, which finally and firmly
established Mr. Lincoln's reputation as a speaker and
statesman, was in 1858, when he and Douglas once
more were brought to a face encounter before the
people of Illinois, as opposing candidates for the U.
S. Senate.</p>

<p>During the months of August, September and October,
according to the honest western custom, these two
opposing candidates stumped the State together, and
presented their opposing claims and views in a series
of public gatherings. These meetings were in consequence
of Mr. Lincoln's invitation, but Mr. Douglas
in accepting adroitly contrived to name terms that
gave him the opening and the closing turns, not only
of the whole series, but of four out of seven of the
meetings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
In the June and July preceding, Mr. Lincoln made
three other speeches, two at Springfield and one at
Chicago, which may be considered a sort of preface
to the great debates. The first of these, at Springfield,
June 17, 1858, was in some respects the most
remarkable of Mr. Lincoln's oratorical productions.
It was made at the close of the Republican State
Convention which nominated Mr. Lincoln a candidate
for the U.&nbsp;S. Senate; and its opening paragraph is so
remarkable for style, so heavy with meaning, and so
instinct with political foresight, that it is worth quoting
entire. It is as follows:</p>

<p>"Mr. President, and Gentlemen of the Convention:&mdash;If
we could first know where we are, and whither
we are tending, we could better judge what to do,
and how to do it. We are now far into the fifth year
since a policy was initiated with the avowed object
and confident promise of putting an end to slavery
agitation. Under the operation of that policy, that
agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly
augmented. In my opinion it will not cease until a
crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house
divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this
government cannot endure permanently half slave and
half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved&mdash;I
do not expect the house to fall&mdash;but I do expect
it will cease to be divided. It will become all one
thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery
will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where
the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the
course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
push it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in all
the States, old as well as new, North as well as South."</p>

<p>In this brief statement, Mr. Lincoln set forth the
whole object of the southern and northern parties on
the slavery question, and though he did not prophesy
which way the contest would be decided, he did
prophesy exactly the two alternatives to one of which
the country was necessarily to advance. It is further
noticeable here that Mr. Lincoln's statement includes
exactly the same prophecy, only not so classically
worded, as Mr. Seward's famous phrase, in his speech
at Rochester, the following October, of "an Irrepressible
Conflict." And once more; the opening sentence,
as a writer upon Mr. Lincoln has shown, is in like
manner curiously coincident in thought with the first
sentence of another still more famous speech&mdash;Daniel
Webster's reply to Hayne. Mr. Webster said:</p>

<p>"When the mariner has been tossed for many days
in thick weather, and on an unknown sea, he naturally
avails himself of the first pause in the storm, the earliest
glance of the sun, to take his latitude, and ascertain
how far the elements have driven him from his
true course. Let us imitate that prudence, and before
we float further, refer to the point from which we departed,
that we may at least be able to conjecture
where we now are."</p>

<p>That is a stately and sonorous opening, majestic
and poetical. Now compare it with Mr. Lincoln's
synonym: "If we could first know where we are,
and whither we are tending, we could better judge
what to do, and how to do it." The thing could not
have been said more shortly, more directly, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
clearly, more strongly in English. As the writer
observes from whom this parallel is taken, "Mr. Webster
used eighty-two words, nearly a quarter of them having
over one syllable; Mr. Lincoln only twenty-five,
of which only three, or less than one-eighth, have
more than one syllable. Counting still more closely,
we find that Mr. Webster used 347 letters, to Mr. Lincoln's
88." In less than one-third the words, in just
over one-fourth the letters, and without the least approach
to a figure of speech, Mr. Lincoln said what
Mr. Webster did. "This," to quote once more, "may
seem a petty method of comparing orators; but it
reveals a great secret of directness, clearness, simplicity
and force of style; it goes far to explain how Mr.
Lincoln convinced an audience."</p>

<p>"This speech," says Mr. Arnold, "was the text
of the great debate between Lincoln and Douglas."
It states the question in the United States as
between slavery and freedom, with very great strength
and plainness, and lays down the principles that apply
to it with equal power. It had been carefully prepared
beforehand, as a manifesto for which the times
were ripe. For the first time it placed the speaker publicly
upon advanced anti-slavery ground; and it is by no
means improbable that in taking that ground, Mr. Lincoln
had some secret conscious or half conscious feeling
not only that he was marking out the place that
his party must occupy in the coming struggle, but
that in doing so he assumed the place of standard-bearer.
He explained the doctrines of the Nebraska
Act, and the Dred Scott decision; showed how the
Democratic party had become ranged on the side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
slavery; explained how the result of the Dred Scott
decision, together with the indifferent policy so jauntily
vaunted by Douglas, of "not caring whether slavery
were voted up or down," must result in a final
victory of slavery; and showed how Mr. Douglas'
doctrines permitted and invited that final victory.
And having thus showed "where we are, and whither
we are tending," he ended with a solemn but cheering
exhortation, "what to do and how to do it." "The
result," he said, "is not doubtful. We shall not fail,
if we stand firm we shall not fail. Wise counsels may
accelerate, or mistakes delay it, but sooner or later,
<span class="smcap smaller">THE VICTORY IS SURE TO COME</span>."</p>

<p>That is the language, not of a party politician, recommending
expedient nostrums, but of a statesman
who feels profoundly that his people are sound at
heart, and will assuredly one day do full justice; who
proclaims in advance the eternal victory of the right
side, and boldly calls on all who hear him to advance
up to the line of their own consciences.</p>

<p>Before delivering this speech, Mr. Lincoln locked
himself into a room with his partner, Mr. Herndon,
and read him the first paragraph of the speech.
"What do you think of it?" said he. Herndon answered,
"I think it is all true, but I doubt whether it
is good policy to say it now." Mr. Lincoln replied,
"That makes no difference; it is the truth, and the
nation is entitled to it." This was both honest and
politic; for if the ground of principle as against expediency
had not been taken, there was none left to
oppose the reasonings of Mr. Douglas, which were
extremely adroit, and so far as expediency admitted,
indeed unanswerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
In the conduct of that remarkable campaign of
1858, Mr. Douglas was the advocate of expediency,
Mr. Lincoln of principle. Mr. Douglas appealed to
the prejudices of the white race against the black, and
argued in favor of present ease and selfish indifference
to justice in our conduct as a nation. Mr. Lincoln
incessantly appealed to the consciences of his audience,
to all that part of human nature which is kindly,
which is just, which is noble; to the broad doctrines
upon which our national freedom was originally based.
It is true that along with these main currents of debate
numerous minor questions and side issues came
up; but such was the pervading color, the chief drift
of the discussion. Over and over and over again,
there sounds out among the words of Douglas, "This
is a white man's government; the negro ought not to
vote." And even more constant is the lofty reply, "I
stand by the Declaration of Independence, and the
everlasting rights of humanity. The negro is a man,
and he ought to have all the rights of a man!"</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln's speech at Springfield, on June 17th,
has been briefly described. Mr. Douglas, coming home
to his own State, to justify his course, and receive his
re-election, answered him in his Chicago speech of
July 9th, and Mr. Lincoln rejoined next day. Douglas
spoke again, at Bloomington on the 16th, and at
Springfield on the 17th, and on the latter day Mr.
Lincoln spoke also at Springfield. In this speech he
set forth a curious and characteristic contrast between
himself and his opponent, in a grotesque and sarcastic
manner that must have told sharply upon his western
audience, while its comic surface is underlaid with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
usual solid basis of conscious adherence to justice and
principle. Mr. Lincoln said:</p>

<p>"Senator Douglas is of world-wide renown. All
the anxious politicians of his party, or who have been
of his party for years past, have been looking upon
him as certainly, at no distant day, to be the President
of the United States. They have seen in his round,
jolly, fruitful face, post-offices, land-offices, marshalships
and cabinet appointments, chargeships and foreign
missions, bursting and sprouting out in wonderful
exuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their greedy
hands. And as they have been gazing upon this attractive
picture so long, they cannot, in the little distraction
that has taken place in the party, bring themselves to
give up the charming hope; but with greedier anxiety
they rush about him, sustain him, and give him marches,
triumphal entries, and receptions beyond what
even in the days of his highest prosperity they could
have brought about in his favor. On the contrary,
nobody has ever expected me to be President. In
my poor, lean, lank face, nobody has ever seen that
any cabbages were sprouting out. These are disadvantages,
all taken together, that the Republicans labor
under. We have to fight this battle upon principle,
and upon principle alone. I am, in a certain
sense, made the standard-bearer in behalf of the Republicans.
I was made so merely because there had
to be some one so placed&mdash;I being in no wise preferable
to any other one of the twenty-five&mdash;perhaps a
hundred, we have in the Republican ranks. Then I
say I wish it to be distinctly understood and borne in
mind, that we have to fight this battle without many&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
without any&mdash;of the external aids which
are brought to bear against us. So I hope those with
whom I am surrounded have principle enough to nerve
themselves for the task and leave nothing undone that
can be fairly done, to bring about the right result."</p>

<p>Two years before, Mr. Lincoln had used even stronger
terms in contrasting himself and his antagonist.
In 1856 he said: "Twenty-two years ago, Judge
Douglas and I first became acquainted; we were both
young men&mdash;he a trifle younger than I. Even then
we were both ambitious, I perhaps quite as much as
he. With me, the race of ambition has been a failure&mdash;a
flat failure. With him, it has been one of splendid
success. His name fills the nation, and it is
not unknown in foreign lands. I affect no contempt
for the high eminence he has reached. <i>So reached
that the oppressed of my species might have shared
with me in the elevation</i>, I would rather stand on that
eminence than wear the richest crown that ever pressed
a monarch's brow."</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln's exact position on the emancipation
question at this time, is an interesting illustration of
his firm adherence to principle, and at the same time
of his extreme caution in touching established laws,
and his natural tendency to give voice to the average
public sentiment of his day, rather than to go beyond
it, or to reprove that sentiment for not going further.
He averred over and over again, that he was "not in
favor of negro citizenship;" but he said "there is no
reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to
all the rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence&mdash;the
right of life, liberty and the pursuit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
happiness. In the right to eat the bread without the
leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he
is my equal, and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the
equal of every other man."</p>

<p>The same primary granite substratum of moral
right, of everlasting justice, underlies all these speeches.
It crops out here and there, in passages, a specimen
of which is worth quoting, not merely for the sake of
their aptness then or now; but also as excellent patterns
for the application of moral principles to political
practices&mdash;a lesson peculiarly important in a republic,
simply because its diligent employment is the
sole possible basis of national strength and happiness.
In the debate at Quincy, October 13th, Mr. Lincoln
stated a whole code of political ethics, along with its
application to the case in hand, in one paragraph, as
follows:</p>

<p>"We have in this nation this element of domestic
slavery. It is a matter of absolute certainty that it is
a disturbing element. It is the opinion of all the
great men who have expressed an opinion upon it,
that it is a dangerous element. We keep up a controversy
in regard to it. That controversy necessarily
springs from difference of opinion, and if we can learn
exactly&mdash;can reduce to the lowest elements&mdash;what that
difference of opinion is, we perhaps shall be better
prepared for discussing the different systems of policy
that we would propose in regard to that disturbing
element. I suggest that the difference of opinion,
reduced to its lowest terms, is no other than the difference
between the men who think slavery a wrong
and those who do not think it a wrong. The Republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
party think it wrong&mdash;we think it is a moral, a
social and a political wrong. We think it is a wrong
not confining itself merely to the persons or the States
where it exists, but that it is a wrong in its tendency,
to say the least, that it extends itself to the existence
of the whole nation. Because we think it wrong, we
propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a
wrong. We deal with it as with any other wrong, in
so far as we can prevent its growing any larger, and
so deal with it that in the run of time there may be
some promise of an end to it. We have a due regard
to the actual presence of it amongst us and the difficulties
of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way,
and all the Constitutional obligations thrown about it.
I suppose that in reference both to its actual existence
in the nation, and to our Constitutional obligations,
we have no right at all to disturb it in the States
where it exists, and we profess that we have no more
inclination to disturb it than we have the right to do
it. We go further than that; we don't propose to
disturb it where, in one instance, we think the Constitution
would permit us. We think the Constitution
would permit us to disturb it in the District of Columbia.
Still we do not propose to do that, unless it
should be in terms which I don't suppose the nation
is very likely soon to agree to&mdash;the terms of making
the emancipation gradual and compensating the unwilling
owners. Where we suppose we have the Constitutional
right, we restrain ourselves in reference to
the actual existence of the institution and the difficulties
thrown about it. We also oppose it as an evil
so far as it seeks to spread itself. We insist on the
policy that shall restrict it to its present limits."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Still more sharply and strongly he stated the question
in the last debate, at Alton, as simply this: Is
Slavery wrong?</p>

<p>"That is the real issue. That is the issue that will
continue in this country when these poor tongues of
Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent. It is the
eternal struggle between these two principles&mdash;right
and wrong&mdash;throughout the world. They are the two
principles that have stood face to face from the beginning
of time; and will ever continue to struggle.
The one is the common right of humanity and the
other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle,
in whatever shape it develops itself. It is the
same spirit that says, "You work and toil and earn
bread, and I'll eat it." No matter in what shape it
comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks
to bestride the people of his own nation and live by
the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an
apology for enslaving another race, it is the same
tyrannical principle."</p>

<p>With equal force he often exposed and rebuked the
moral levity shown by his opponent&mdash;his affectation of
indifference to all principle, his supercilious dazzling
contempt of moral distinctions. In his last speech at
Alton, he very fully reviewed the whole question, and
Mr. Douglas' individual position before the country,
with great breadth and power.</p>

<p>There was as striking a contrast between the externals
of the two champions, as between their political
doctrines. Douglas went pompously up and down the
land, with special trains of railroad cars, bands of music,
long processions, banners, cannon firing, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
the flourish and gaudy show of a triumphing conqueror;
and he is said to have paid away half his fortune
in securing this fatal victory. But Mr. Lincoln went
about almost as frugally, as plainly, as quietly, as if he
had been on one of his accustomed legal circuits, and
reflected with a queer astonishment upon the trifling
sum that he did actually expend. He said to a friend
after the campaign was over, "I don't believe I have
expended in this canvass one cent less than Five Hundred
Dollars in cash!" He sometimes good humoredly
alluded to these demonstrations. "Auxiliary to
these main points," he says, "to be sure, are their
thunderings of cannon, their marching and music, their
fizzle-gigs and fire works; but I will not waste time
with them, they are but the little trappings of the
campaign." Mr. Townsend, a picturesque writer, thus
contrasts the bearing of the two men: "Douglas was
uneasily arrogant in Lincoln's presence; the latter,
never sensitive nor flurried, so grew by his imperturbability
that when he reached the White House, Mr.
Douglas was less surprised than anybody else. The
great senatorial campaign, in which they figured together,
is remembered by every Springfielder. Douglas,
with his powerful voice and facile energy, went
into it under full steam. Lincoln began lucidly and
cautiously. When they came out of it, Douglas was
worn down with rage and hoarseness, and Lincoln was
fresher than ever. He prepared all the speeches of
this campaign by silent meditation, sitting or lying
alone, studying the flies on the ceiling. "The best evidence
of his superiority in this debate is the fact that
the Republicans circulated both sets of speeches as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
campaign document in 1860, but Mr. Douglas's friends
refused to do so.</p>

<p>And Mr. Arnold, a personal friend of Mr. Lincoln's,
attributes to Mr. Lincoln just that sort of superiority
that comes from a consciousness of being on the right
side and of having an antagonist in whose attitude
there is reason for contempt. "He had one advantage,"
says Mr. Arnold, "over Douglas, he was always
good humored; he had always an apt and happy story
for illustration, and while Douglas was sometimes irritable,
Lincoln never lost his temper." And Mr.
Arnold says that when Lincoln and Douglas came to
Chicago together just after the close of the seven debates,
"Lincoln was in perfect health, his face bronzed
by the prairie suns, but looking and moving like a
trained athlete. His voice was clearer, stronger and
better than when he began the canvass. Douglas was
physically much broken. He was so hoarse that he
could hardly articulate, and was entirely unintelligible
in an ordinary tone."</p>

<p>But the circumstance that shows most clearly of all,
how entirely Mr. Lincoln saw over, and through, and
beyond his adversary, both as statesman and politician,
how entirely he managed him, wielded him, used
him, is the fearful grip into which he put the "Little
Giant" on the question of the conflict between "Popular
Sovereignty" and the Dred Scott decision. In
return for a series of questions by Mr. Douglas, Mr.
Lincoln, having answered them all categorically, prepared
certain others to put to Mr. Douglas; and of
these one was:</p>

<p>"Can the people of a United States Territory, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the
United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to
the formation of a State Constitution?"</p>

<p>When Mr. Lincoln consulted a friend upon this set
of questions, the friend remonstrated against this one;
saying in substance, "In answer, Mr. Douglas must
either accept the Dred Scott decision as binding,
which would lose him the election to the Senate in
consequence of the popular feeling in Illinois against
it, or else that he must assert that his doctrine of "squatter
sovereignty" would enable the territory to keep
slavery out, by "unfriendly legislation," contrary to the
Dred Scott decision. And this," urged the friend, "he
will do; it will satisfy Illinois, and give Douglas the
senatorship. You are only placing the step for him
to rise upon."</p>

<p>"That may be," said Mr. Lincoln, with a shrewd
look, "<i>but if he takes that shoot he never can be President</i>."
This meant, that while the doctrine of legislating
slavery out of a territory might satisfy Illinois, it
would be odious and inadmissible to the whole South,
and that it would therefore render Douglas' election
to the Presidency impossible. And it came to pass
exactly as Mr. Lincoln foretold at this time, and as
he told "Billy" when he returned home at the end
of the canvass. One of Mr. Lincoln's characteristic
sentences afterwards summed all the contradiction of
Douglas' position, in the statement that it was "declaring
that a thing may be lawfully driven away from
a place where it has a lawful right to go."</p>

<p>These seven debates were the most widely known
of Mr. Lincoln's labors in this campaign, but he made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
about fifty other speeches in different parts of the
State.</p>

<p>The result of this celebrated canvass was to return
Douglas to the Senate, although the vote of the people
was in favor of Lincoln. The Legislative districts
in the State had been so arranged by the Democratic
party as to secure their majority in the Legislature.
But even if the popular majority had been
with Douglas, Mr. Lincoln had won. He set out to
lose the State; he set out to carry the nation; and he
did it. It was the foresight of the statesman, contending
with the cunning of the politician. It was
part of the victory that he who really lost thought he
had won. Mr. Herndon, Mr. Lincoln's law partner,
told afterwards how Mr. Lincoln came home and said,
"Billy, I knew I should miss the place, when I competed
for it. <i>This defeat will make me President.</i>"</p>

<p>In the period between this canvass and the Presidential
nomination at Chicago, Mr. Lincoln, while at
work in his profession, did good service in the cause
of freedom in several of the States, making a number
of effective speeches in Ohio, Kansas, and particularly
in New England and New York. His contest with
Douglas had probably already made Mr. Lincoln the
second choice of large numbers of Republicans for
the nomination of 1860. His great speech at Cooper
Institute in February, 1860, confirmed this choice, and
enlarged those numbers.</p>

<p>The invitation which resulted in his great Cooper
Institute speech was originally to give a lecture in
Plymouth Church, in Brooklyn, and he was to receive
$200 for it. After some delay, at last he agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
to speak on February 27th; but the three young men
who had organized the course, thought the time late
in the season, and began to fear that they would lose
money. It sounds curious enough now, to think of a
fear lest a speech by Mr. Lincoln should not refund
$350 expenses, but so they thought. A political
friend of his who had negotiated the engagement, at
last assumed one fourth of the risk, and with a good
deal of trouble, managed to have the speech at Cooper
Institute, instead of Brooklyn. Attempts were
vainly made to induce one and then another Republican
club to assume the risk of the engagement.
The New York Times, in announcing the lecture, kindly
spoke of the speaker as "a lawyer who had some
local reputation in Illinois."</p>

<p>The Cooper Institute speech was prepared with
much care, and was a production of very great power
of logic, history and political statement. It consisted
of an exposition of the true doctrines of the founders
of our nation on the question of slavery, and of the
position of the two parties of the day on the same
question. It was alive and luminous throughout with
the resolute and lofty and uncompromising morality
on principle, which had colored all his debates with
Douglas, and made a very deep impression upon the
audience present, and upon the far greater audience
that read it afterwards.</p>

<p>Its close was very powerful. After showing that
the demands of the South were summed up in the requirement
that the North should call slavery right instead
of wrong, and should then join the south in
acting accordingly, he added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
"If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand
by our duty, fearlessly and effectively. Let us be
diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances
wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored&mdash;contrivances
such as groping for some middle
ground between the right and the wrong, vain as
the search for a man who should be neither a living
man nor a dead man&mdash;such as a policy of "don't
care" on a question about which all true men do care&mdash;such
as Union appeals, beseeching true Union men
to yield to disunionists, reversing the Divine rule, and
calling, not the sinners, but the righteous to repentance&mdash;such
as invocations of Washington, imploring
men to unsay what Washington said, and undo what
Washington did. Neither let us be slandered from
our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened
from it by menaces of destruction to the Government,
nor of dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that
right makes might, and in that faith let us, to the
end, dare to do our duty, as we understand it."</p>

<p>The words are singularly plain, they are nakedly homely.
But the thoughts are very noble and very mighty.</p>

<p>At the close of the speech, the same friend who had
engineered it, made a few remarks, in which he prophesied.
He said, "One of three gentlemen will be our
standard bearer in the Presidential contest of this year;
the distinguished Senator from New York&mdash;Mr. Seward;
the late able and accomplished Governor of Ohio,
Mr. Chase, or the unknown knight who entered the
political list, against the Bois Guilbert of democracy,
Stephen A. Douglas, on the prairies of Illinois, in
1858, and unhorsed him&mdash;Abraham Lincoln."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
The narrator adds, "Some friends joked me after
the meeting, as not being a good prophet. The lecture
was over; all the expenses were paid; I was
handed by the gentlemen interested, the sum of $4.25
as my share of the profits." It is worth adding that
Mr. Lincoln observed to the same gentleman, after his
subsequent tour further eastward, "when I was East,
several gentlemen made about the same remark to me
that you did to-day about the Presidency; they
thought my chances were about equal to the best."</p>

<p>The story of the nomination at Chicago, of the
election, of the perilous journey to Washington, need
not be repeated. While the nominating convention
was sitting, Mr. Lincoln's friends telegraphed to him
that in order to be nominated he needed the votes of
two of the delegations, and that to secure these, he
must promise that if elected the leaders of those delegations
should be made members of his Cabinet. He
telegraphed at once back again; "I authorize no bargains
and will be bound by none." The adoption of
those ten words as a rule would go very far to purify
the whole field of political party action.</p>

<p>Little did the convention that nominated Abraham
Lincoln for President, know what they were doing.
Little did the honest, fatherly, patriotic man, who stood
in his simplicity on the platform at Springfield, asking
the prayers of his townsmen and receiving their
pledges to remember him, foresee how awfully he was
to need those prayers, the prayers of all this nation
and the prayers of all the working, suffering common
people throughout the world. God's hand was upon
him with a visible protection, saving first from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
danger of assassination at Baltimore, and bringing
him safely to our national capital.</p>

<p>Perhaps the imperturbable cool courage of Mr. Lincoln
was the trait in him least appreciated in proportion
to his share of it. He promptly and unhesitatingly
risked his life to keep his Philadelphia appointment
on the way to Washington, filling his programme,
because it was his duty, without any variance for assassins.
It should be here recorded, by the way, that
the story that he fled from Harrisburg, disguised in a
Scotch cap and cloak, which made so much noise in
the country at the time, was a forgery, devised by a
disreputable reporter. Mr. Lincoln never used any
disguises, and it would have required more than one
"Scotch cap" to bring his six feet four down to an
average height.</p>

<p>He was so kind-hearted, so peaceable, so averse,
either to cause or to witness controversy or wrath, that
only the extremest need would force him to the point
of wrath and of fighting. But when the need was
real, the wrath and the fight came out. Whether
moral or physical courage, upon a real demand for it,
it never failed. On his flat boat trip to New Orleans
in his youth, he and his mate, armed only with sticks
of wood, beat off seven negro marauders who attacked
and would have robbed their boat. When
clerk in a country store he seized, flung down and subdued
a bully who was insolent to some women, and
what is more, the beaten bully became his friend. He
once, alone, by suddenly dropping from a scuttle down
upon the platform, kept off a gang of rowdies who
were about to hustle his friend Col. Baker off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
stand. He and Baker once, with no others, escorted
to the hotel, a speaker who was threatened with violence
by a Democratic crowd whom he had offended.
When some Irishmen at Springfield once undertook
to take possession of the poll and restrict the voting
to their friends, Lincoln, hearing of it, stepped into
the first store, seized an axe helve, and marched alone
through the turbulent crowd up to the poll, opening
the road as he went; and alone he kept the ballot-box
free and safe until the foolish crowd gave up their
plan. His anger sometimes&mdash;though very seldom&mdash;flamed
up at ill usage of himself; but never so hotly
as at ill usage to others. When a poor negro citizen
of Illinois was imprisoned at New Orleans, simply for
being a free negro from outside of Louisiana, and was
about to be sold into slavery, to pay jail fees, Mr. Lincoln
found that the Governor of Illinois could not
help the poor fellow. When the fact became plain,
he jumped up and swore, "By the Almighty," he
said, "I'll have that negro back, or I'll have a twenty
years' agitation in Illinois, until the Governor can do
something in the premises!" Somebody sent money
and set the man free; or else the twenty years' agitation
would have begun, and finished too. An officer,
a worthless fellow, after being dismissed and repeatedly
trying to get back into the army, at last insolently
told President Lincoln, "I see you are fully determined
not to do me justice." Now this was just what
he <i>was</i> determined to do him; and in righteous anger
he arose, laid down his papers, collared the fellow,
walked him to the door and flung him out, saying,
"Sir, I give you fair warning, never to show yourself in
this room again. I can bear censure, but not insult!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
In Mr. Lincoln's administration, the world has seen
and wondered at the greatest sign and marvel of our
day, to wit, a plain working man of the people, with
no more culture, instruction or education than any
such working man may obtain for himself, called on
to conduct the passage of a great nation through a
crisis involving the destinies of the whole world. The
eyes of princes, nobles, aristocrats, of dukes, earls,
scholars, statesmen, warriors, all turned on the plain
backwoodsman, with his simple sense, his imperturbable
simplicity, his determined self-reliance, his impracticable
and incorruptible honesty, as he sat amid the
war of conflicting elements, with unpretending steadiness,
striving to guide the national ship through a
channel at whose perils the world's oldest statesmen
stood aghast. The brilliant courts of Europe levelled
their opera glasses at the phenomenon. Fair ladies
saw that he had horny hands and disdained white
gloves; dapper diplomatists were shocked at his system
of etiquette; but old statesmen, who knew the
terrors of that passage, were wiser than court ladies
and dandy diplomatists, and watched him with a fearful
curiosity, simply asking, "Will that awkward old
backwoodsman really get that ship through? If he
does, it will be time for us to look about us." Sooth
to say, our own politicians were somewhat shocked
with his State papers at first. "Why not let <i>us</i> make
them a little more conventional, and file them to a
classical pattern?" "No," was his reply, "I shall write
them myself. <i>The people will understand them.</i>"
"But this or that form of expression is not elegant,
nor classical." "<i>The people will understand it</i>," was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
his invariable reply. And whatever may be said of
his State papers, as compared with the diplomatic
standards, it has been a fact that they have always
been wonderfully well understood by the people, and
that since the time of Washington, the State papers
of no President have more controlled the popular
mind. And one reason for this is, that they have been
informal and undiplomatic. They have more resembled
a father's talks to his children than a State paper.
And they have had that relish and smack of the soil,
that appeal to the simple human heart and head, which
is a greater power in writing than the most artful clerices
of rhetoric. Lincoln might well say with the
apostle, "But though I be rude in speech yet not in
knowledge, but we have been thoroughly <i>made manifest
among you</i> in all things." His rejection of what
is called fine writing, was as deliberate as St. Paul's,
and for the same reason&mdash;because he felt that he was
speaking on a subject which must be made clear to
the lowest intellect, though it should fail to captivate
the highest. But we say of Lincoln's writings, that
for all true, manly purposes of writing, there are passages
in his State papers that could not be better put&mdash;they
are absolutely perfect. They are brief, condensed,
intense, and with a power of insight and expression
which make them worthy to be inscribed in
letters of gold. Such are some passages of the celebrated
letter to the Springfield convention, especially
that masterly one where he compares the conduct of
the patriotic and loyal blacks with that of the treacherous
and disloyal whites. No one can read this letter
and especially the passage mentioned, without feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the influence of a mind both strong and generous.
"Peace does not appear so distant as it did. I hope
it will come soon and come to stay; and so come as
to be worth the keeping in all future time. It will
then have been proved that among freemen there can
be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet,
and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose
their case and pay the cost. And then there will be
some black men who can remember that with silent
tongue, and clenched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised
bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this
great consummation, while I fear there will be some
white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart
and deceitful speech they have striven to hinder it."</p>

<p>The lesson of Mr. Lincoln's career as President, is
a manifold one. He was in a strangely full and close
manner the exponent, the representative, the federal
head, the voice, the plenary agent, of the people of
the United States. As such, his life teaches what the
war teaches, to wit; the strength and the magnificent
morality of an intelligent people, trained in self-control,
in thought, in the doctrines of justice and freedom,
and in the fear of God.</p>

<p>As one man's life, the life of Mr. Lincoln after his
election is simply the picture over again, on a gigantic
scale, in stronger colors, in bolder relief, of the
same courage, devotion, strength, industry, energy,
sense, decision, kindness, caution, instinctive feeling
of what was right and what was practicable, and deliberate
execution of it, that had marked his career
before, as the political leader in a great state controversy,
and as a laborious lawyer at the bar. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
mounted upon a higher plane of action, his views became
enlarged and elevated. Especially is it noticeable
how as President, he was very much more open
and specific in avowing an immediate dependence upon
help higher than man's, in doing the work before
him. Mr. Lincoln was naturally inclined to religious
feelings. His habit of considering all the affairs of
life from the religious point of view, at the tribunal
of the laws of God, is clearly traceable in his private
history and even in his political campaigns. He was
not obtrusive nor unreasonable however in avowals
of this feeling. It would have been out of place to
request the prayers of his fellow citizens during the
debates with Douglas, almost as much as to ask the
prayers of the jury while arguing a case. But
while placed at the head of his nation, during the
vastest peril of its existence&mdash;while occupying the
most prominent, the most powerful, the most responsible,
the most difficult, and the most dangerous position
upon the whole round world&mdash;while at the very
front of the very vanguard of humanity in the great
battle which was deciding whether good or evil should
overcome&mdash;in such a position, no avowals of the need
of Divine aid, no repetition of the consciousness of
that need, no requests for the sympathy and the help
of all good men's prayers, could be too frequent or
too free. This profound sense of human weakness
and of God's strength, and a distinct sentiment of
mournful foreboding, give the whole coloring to the
brief address in which he bade good bye to his neighbors
at Springfield, at setting out for Washington in
1861.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
This habit of religious feeling, and the avowal of it,
remained a very marked one during all Mr. Lincoln's
Presidency. Subordinate to this, the acts of his official
life, his written and spoken utterances, and his
personal conduct, were mainly marked by solicitous
and extreme sense of duty, unfailing resolution, unerring
tact and wisdom, and a kindness and patience
entirely unparalleled in the history of governments.
These traits were often hidden by his quaint modes of
expression, by the wonderful flow of humorous anecdotes
which he so constantly used in arguing, in answering,
in evading, or for entertainment; and by his
confirmed habit of arguing all questions against himself,
against his own views, before coming to a conclusion.
These externals often concealed him, often
occasioned him to be misunderstood, distrusted, and
opposed. It was only as time passed on, and his public
acts gradually formed themselves into his history,
that it was possible for those broad and massive
characteristics to be seen in a just perspective. Now
however, they are visible throughout all his life,
whether traced in anecdote, in speech, in state papers,
in cabinet debates, in intercourse with the representatives
of bodies of the people, or in executive orders
and acts.</p>

<p>Of all these traits, Mr. Lincoln's kindness was unquestionably
the rarest, the most wonderful. It may
be doubted whether any human being ever lived
whose whole nature was so perfectly sweet with the
readiness to do kind actions; so perfectly free from
even the capacity of revenge. He could not even
leave a pig in distress. He once on circuit, drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
past a pig, stuck fast in a mud hole. Having on a
suit of new clothes, he felt unable to afford them for
the pig, but after going two miles, he could not stand
it, turned and drove back, made a platform of rails,
helped out the pig, spoiled his new clothes, and
then went contentedly about his business. He used
to help his poor clients with money&mdash;a ridiculous
thing in a lawyer. He was quite as helpless about
traitors and deserters and criminals, as about pigs; even
when pardoning or non-retaliation was actually doing
harm. The beseechings and tears of women, the sight
of a little child, even a skilful picture of the sorrow
of a scoundrel's friends, was almost certain to gain
whatever favor they sought. It really sometimes seemed
as if he was tenderer of individual lives than of multitudes
of them, so nearly impossible was it for him
to pronounce sentence of death or to forbear the gift
of life. His doorkeeper had standing orders never to
delay from one day to another any message asking for
the saving of life. He undoubtedly did harm by giving
life to deserters, and thus weakening army discipline.
He heard a child cry in his anteroom one day,
and calling his usher, had the woman that carried the
child shown in. She had been waiting three days, by
some mischance. Her husband was to be shot. She
stated her case; the pardon was at once granted; she
came out of the office praying and weeping; and the
old usher, touching her shawl, told her who had really
saved her husband's life. "Madam," said he, "the
baby did it."</p>

<p>One of his generals once urgently remonstrated
with him for rendering desertion safe, though it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
seriously weakening the army. "Mr. General," said
Mr. Lincoln, "there are already too many weeping widows
in the United States. For God's sake don't ask
me to add to the number, for I won't do it." Even
to put a stop to the unutterable horrors which were
slowly murdering our brave men in the rebel prisons,
he could not retaliate. He said, "I can never, never
starve men like that. Whatever others may say or do,
I never can, and I never will, be accessory to such
treatment of human beings." Once, after the massacre
at Fort Pillow, he pledged himself in a public
speech that there should be a retaliation. But that
pledge he could not keep, and he did not.</p>

<p>His perfectly sweet kindness of feeling was as inexhaustible
towards the rebels as such, as towards dumb
beasts, or the poor and unfortunate of his own loyal
people, and it was shown as clearly in his state papers
and speeches as in any private act or word. That
sentiment, and one other&mdash;the unconditional determination
to adhere to the doctrines of the Declaration
of Independence and to do his sworn official duty&mdash;colored
the series of speeches which he made on his
way to Washington. At Philadelphia, where he was
especially impressed with associations about the old Independence
Hall, he said, speaking of that edifice,
and standing within the old Hall itself:</p>

<p>"All the political sentiments I entertain have been
drawn, so far as I have been able to draw them, from
the sentiments which originated in and were given to
the world from this hall. I have never had a feeling,
politically, that did not spring from the sentiments
embodied in the Declaration of Independence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Then he referred to the doctrine of freedom in that
instrument; and he said:</p>

<p>"But if this country can not be saved without giving
up that principle, I was about to say I would rather
be assassinated in this spot than surrender it. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
I have said nothing but what I am willing to live by,
and if it be the pleasure of Almighty God, to die by."</p>

<p>These references to assassination and death, were no
casual flourishes of oratory. They were deliberate
defiances of the fate which had already been denounced
against the speaker, in public and in private,
which continued to be threatened during all the rest
of his life, and which finally actually befel him, but
the fear of which never made him turn pale nor waver
in his duty. He began as soon as he was nominated,
to receive anonymous letters from the South threatening
him with death. They became so frequent that
he kept a separate file of them. They continued to
come, up to the year of his death. The first one or
two, he said, made him "a little uncomfortable;" but
afterwards he only filed them. The train on which
he left home for the East, was to have been thrown
off the track. A hand grenade was hidden in one
of the cars. An association was known to exist at
Baltimore for the express purpose of killing him.
When therefore he spoke as he did at Philadelphia, it
was doubtless with a feeling that some one concerned
in these plans was probably hearing him, and understanding
him. It was, no doubt, at the same time a
sort of vow, taken upon himself under the feelings
aroused by the birth-place of the Declaration which
he had so often and so well defended. Whether a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
challenge, a vow, or a mere statement of principle, he
kept his word. He lived by it, and he died by it.</p>

<p>The same mixture of firmness and kindness appears
in the First Inaugural, and in this document there is
also another most characteristic element;&mdash;circumspect
adherence to the Constitution as he understood it, and
most remarkable care and skill in the language used
to interpret law, or to announce his own conclusions
or purposes. Lover of freedom as he was, and believer
in the rights of man, he had already been invariably
careful not to demand from the masses of men
whom he sought to influence, more than they could be
expected to give. Now, he went even further. He
expressly and clearly avowed his intention to execute
all that he had sworn, even the laws most distasteful
to any freeman. In speaking of the crisis of the moment,
and after setting forth his doctrine of national
sovereignty and an unbroken Union, he promised to
maintain it as far as he could, and added:</p>

<p>"Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my
part; and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless
my rightful masters, the American people, shall
withhold the requisite means, or in some authoritative
manner direct the contrary."</p>

<p>Then, as if to avert ill feeling if possible:</p>

<p>"I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but
only as the declared purpose of the Union, that it will
constitutionally defend and maintain itself."</p>

<p>Then, with careful adherence to the mildest terms
possible&mdash;could anything be a more peaceful assertion
of national right than the simple "hold, occupy and
possess"?&mdash;he says what the nation will do:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
"In doing this there need be no bloodshed or violence,
and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon
the national authority. The power confided to me
will be used to hold, occupy and possess the property
and places belonging to the government, and to collect
the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be
necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion,
no using of force against or among the people anywhere."</p>

<p>The remainder of the Inaugural is just such a kindly,
homely, earnest, sincere, straight-forward appeal to
the South, as he might have made in a country court-house
in Illinois, "taking off his coat, leaning upon
the rail of the jury box, and singling out a leading
juryman and addressing him in a conversational tone."
Having stated the case, and once more barely repeated
that it was "his duty to administer the present government
as it came to his hands, and to transmit it
unimpaired by him to his successor," he then quietly
but powerfully appeals to his own two life-long trusts,
God Almighty, and the free people of America. He
asks:</p>

<p>"Why should there not be a patient confidence in
the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any better
or equal hope in the world? In our present differences,
is either party without faith of being in the
right? If the Almighty Ruler of nations, with his
eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the North,
or on yours of the South, that truth and that justice
will surely prevail, by the judgment of the great tribunal
of the American people."</p>

<p>And the final paragraphs are sad and heavy with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
unutterable longings and yearnings for peace; so that
the words, plain and simple as they are, are full of
deep and melancholy music:</p>

<p>"You can have no conflict without being yourselves
the aggressors. You have no oath registered in
heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have
the most solemn one, to 'preserve, protect and defend'
it.</p>

<p>I am loth to close. We are not enemies, but friends.
We must not be enemies. Though passion may have
strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.
The mystic cord of memory, stretching from every
battle-field and patriot grave to every living heart and
hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the
chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely
they will be, by the better angels of our nature."</p>

<p>As the war went on, the same unwavering decision,
the same caution and kindness marked the whole action
of the Executive. Especially were these traits
exhibited in his dealings with the main question at
issue, that of slavery.</p>

<p>On this point he bore a pressure such as it is safe to
say no mortal son of earth ever bore before or since.
The interests of the great laboring, suffering classes
that go to make up human nature, were all at this period
of history condensed into one narrow channel,
like that below Niagara where the waters of all the
great lakes are heaped up in ridges, and seem, in
Scripture language, to "utter their voices and lift up
their hands on high." Like the course of those heavy
waters the great cause weltered into a place where
its course resembled that sullen whirlpool below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
falls where the awful waters go round and round in
blindly, dizzy masses, and seem with dumb tossings
and dark agonies to seek in vain for a clear, open
channel. In this dread vortex, from time to time are
seen whirling helplessly the bodies of drowned men,
fragments of wrecked boats splintered and shattered,
and trees torn to ghastly skeletons, which from time
to time dart up from the whirling abyss with a sort
of mad, impatient despair.</p>

<p>So we can all remember when the war had struggled
on a year or two&mdash;when a hundred thousand
men, the life and light and joy of as many families,
who entered it warm with hope and high in aspiration,
were all lying cold and low, and yet without the
least apparent progress towards a result&mdash;when the
resistance only seemed to have become wider, deeper,
more concentrated, better organized, by all that awful
waste of the best treasures of the nation; then was
the starless night&mdash;the horror of the valley of the
shadow of death. Above, darkness filled with whisperings,
and jibes, and sneers of traitor fiends; on one
side a pit, on the other a quagmire, and in the gloom
all faces gathered blackness, and even friends and partisans
looked strangely on each other. Confidence began
to be shaken. Each separate party blamed the
other as they wandered in the darkness. It was one
of the strange coincidences which show the eternal
freshness of Scripture language in relation to human
events, that the church lesson from the Old Testament
which was read in the churches the Sunday after the
attack on Sumter, was the prediction of exactly such
a conflict:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
"Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the
men of war draw near; let them come up:</p>

<p>Beat your plough-shares into swords, and your pruning-hooks
into spears: let the weak say, I <i>am</i> strong.</p>

<p>Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and
gather yourselves together round about: thither cause
thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord.</p>

<p>Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: the
press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is
great.</p>

<p>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for
the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.</p>

<p><i>The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the
stars shall withdraw their shining.</i> The Lord also
shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem;
and the heavens and the earth shall shake:
but the Lord <i>will be</i> the hope of his people, and the
strength of the children of Israel. So shall ye know
that I am the Lord your God."</p>

<p>The repeated defeats, disasters, and distresses that
had come upon the Union cause stirred the conscience
of all the religious portion of the community. They
remembered the parallels in the Old Testament where
the armies of Israel were turned back before the
heathen, because they cherished within themselves
some accursed thing&mdash;they began to ask whether the
Achan who had stolen the wedge of gold and Babylonish
vest in our midst was not in truth the cause
why God would not go forth with our armies! and
the pressure upon Lincoln to end the strife by declaring
emancipation, became every day more stringent;
at the same time the pressure of every opposing party
became equally intense, and Lincoln by his peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
nature and habits, must listen to all, and take time to
ponder and weigh all. In consequence there was a
time when he pleased nobody. Each party was incensed
at the degree of attention he gave to the other.
He might say, in the language of the old prophet, at
this time, "Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast
borne me a man of strife, and a man of contention
to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury,
nor men have lent to me on usury; <i>yet</i> every one of
them doth curse me." He was, like the great Master
whom he humbly followed, despised and rejected
of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with
grief; we hid, as it were, our faces from him, he
was despised, and we esteemed him not. Like the
poor, dumb, suffering, down-trodden classes for whom
he stood, he had no prestige of personal advantages,
or of that culture which comes from generations of
wealth and ease. His method of thought and expression
had not the stamp of any old aristocratic tradition.
He was a sign upon the earth&mdash;the sign and
the leader of a new order of events in which the
power and the prestige should be in the hands of the
plain, simple common people, and not in those of
privileged orders. But the time had not yet come,
and now was their hour of humiliation, and while in
England the poor operatives of Manchester bravely
and manfully bore starvation caused by want of cotton,
rather than ask their government to break the
blockade and get it for them; while the poor silk
weavers of Lyons, and the poorer classes all over Europe
trembled, and hoped, and sympathised with the
struggling cause and its unfashionable leader&mdash;all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
great, gay, successful, fashionable world went the other
way. Punch had his jolly caricatures of Lincoln's
long, thin face, and anxious perplexities, and the caricatures
of Paris were none the less merry. Even in
America there was a time when some of his most
powerful friends doubted his fitness for his position,
and criticisms filled the columns of every newspaper.
In Washington, every fop and every fool felt at liberty
to make a jest at the expense of his want of dignity,
and his personal awkwardness. He was freely called
an ape, a satyr, a stupid blockhead, for even the ass
can kick safely and joyfully at a lion in a net. Even
his cabinet and best friends said nothing for him, and
kept an ominous and gloomy silence.</p>

<p>Lincoln knew all this, and turned it over in the
calm recesses of his mind, with a quiet endurance,
gilded at times by a gleam of the grim, solemn humor
peculiar to himself. "I cannot <i>make</i> generals," he
said once, "I would if I could." At another, to an
important man who had been pressing some of his
own particular wisdom upon him, "Perhaps you'd like
to try to run the machine yourself." Somebody gave
him a series of powerful criticisms which a distinguished
writer had just poured forth on him. "I read them
all through," he said quaintly, "and then I said to
myself, Well, Abraham Lincoln, are you a man, or are
you a dog?"</p>

<p>No man in the great agony suffered more or deeper,
but it was with a dry, weary, patient pain, that many
mistook for insensibility. "Whichever way it ends,"
he said to the writer, on one occasion, "I have the
impression that I shan't last long after it's over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
After the dreadful repulse at Fredericksburg, he is
reported to have said, "If there is a man out of hell
that suffers more than I do, I pity him." In those
dark days, his heavy eyes and worn and weary air
told how our reverses wore upon him, and yet there
was a never failing fund of patience at bottom that sometimes
rose to the surface in bubbles of quaint sayings or
a story that forced a laugh even from himself. The humor
of Lincoln was the oil that lubricated the otherwise
dry and wiry machinery of his mind. The power
of looking at men and things with reference to
their humorous side, enabled him to bear without
irritation many things in the political joltings and
jarrings of his lot, which would have driven a more
nervous man frantic. It is certainly a great advantage
to be so made that one can laugh at times when crying
will do no good, and Lincoln not only had his own
laugh in the darkest days, but the wherewithal to
bring a laugh from a weary neighbor. His jests and
stories helped off many a sorry hour, and freshened
the heart of his hearer for another pull in the galling
harness.</p>

<p>He saw through other men who thought all the
while they were instructing or enlightening him, with
a sort of dry, amused patience. He allowed the most
tedious talker to prose to him, the most shallow and
inflated to advise him, reserving only to himself the
right to a quiet chuckle far down in the depths of his
private consciousness. Thus all sorts of men and all
sorts of deputations saw him, had their talks, bestowed
on him all their tediousness, and gave him the benefit
of their opinions; not a creature was denied access,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
not a soul so lowly but might have their chance to
bore the soul of this more lowly servant of the people.
His own little, private, quiet, harmless laugh
was his small comfort under all these inflictions.
Sometimes the absolute confidence with which all
contending sides urged their opinions and measures
upon him, seemed to strike him with a solemn sense
of the ludicrous. Thus when Dr. Cheever, at the
head of a committee of clergymen, had been making
a vigorous, authoritative appeal to him in Old Testament
language, to end all difficulties by emancipation,
Lincoln seemed to meditate gravely, and at last answered
slowly, "Well, gentlemen, it is not very often
that one is favored with a <i>delegation direct from the
Almighty</i>!"</p>

<p>Washington, at this time, was one great hospital of
wounded soldiers; the churches, the public buildings
all filled with the maimed, the sick and suffering, and
Lincoln's only diversion from the perplexity of state
was the oversight of these miseries. "Where do you
dine?" said one to him in our hearing. "Well, I
don't dine, I just browse round a little, now and
then." There was something irresistibly quaint and
pathetic in the odd, rustic tone in which this was
spoken.</p>

<p>Even the Emancipation Proclamation&mdash;that one flag
stone in the wide morass of despondency on which
the wearied man at last set firm foothold, did not at
first seem to be a first step into the land of promise.</p>

<p>It was uttered too soon to please some parties, too
late to please others. In England it was received in
the face of much military ill success, with the scoffing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
epigram that the President had proclaimed liberty in
the states where he had no power, and retained slavery
in those where he had. It is true there was to this
the sensible and just reply that he only gained the
right to emancipate by this war power, and that of
course this did not exist in states that were not at war;
but when was ever a smart saying stopped in its
course by the slow considerations and explanations of
truth?</p>

<p>The battle of Gettysburg was the first argument
that began to convince mankind that Mr. Lincoln was
right. It has been well said, that in this world nothing
succeeds but <i>success</i>. Bonaparte professed his
belief that Providence always went with the strongest
battalions, and therein he expressed about the average
opinion of this world. Vicksburg and Gettysburg
changed the whole face of the nation&mdash;they were
the first stations outside of the valley of the shadow of
death.</p>

<p>The nation took new courage&mdash;even the weary
clamorers for peace at any price, began to shout on the
right side, and to hope that peace might come through
northern victory, and so it <i>did</i> come, they did not care
how.</p>

<p>Whereas a few months before, Lincoln was universally
depreciated, doubted, scoffed and scorned, now
he found himself re-elected to the Presidential chair,
by an overwhelming majority. It was in fact almost
an election by acclamation. When the votes were being
counted in New York late at night, and this victory
became apparent, the vast surging assembly at
the motion of one individual, uncovered their heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and sang a solemn Doxology&mdash;an affecting incident
which goes far to show what sort of feelings lay at the
bottom of this vast movement, and how profoundly
the people felt that this re-election of Lincoln was a
vital step in their onward progress.</p>

<p>At this hour the nation put the broad seal of its approbation
on all his past course. At this moment she
pledged herself to follow him and him alone to the
end.</p>

<p>Perhaps never was man re-elected who used fewer
of popular arts&mdash;made fewer direct efforts. He was indeed
desirous to retain the place, for though he estimated
himself quite humbly, still he was of opinion
that on the whole his was as safe a hand as any, and
he had watched the navigation so far as to come to
love the hard helm, at which he had stood so painfully.
In his usual quaint way he expressed his idea
by a backwoods image. Alluding to the frequent fordings
of turbulent streams that are the lot of the western
traveller, he said, "It is'nt best to swap horses
in the middle of a creek."</p>

<p>There was something almost preternatural in the
calmness with which Lincoln accepted the news of his
re-election. The first impulse seemed to be to disclaim
all triumph over the opposing party, and to soberly
gird up his loins to go on with his work to the
end.</p>

<p>His last inaugural has been called by one of the
London newspapers "the noblest political document
known to history."</p>

<p>It was characterized by a solemn religious tone, so
peculiarly free from earthly passion, that it seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
us now, who look back on it in the light of what has
followed, as if his soul had already parted from earthly
things, and felt the powers of the world to come. It
was not the formal state-paper of the chief of a party
in an hour of victory, so much as the solemn soliloquy
of a great soul reviewing its course under a vast responsibility,
and appealing from all earthly judgments
to the tribunal of Infinite Justice. It was a solemn
clearing of his soul for the great sacrament of death:</p>

<p>"<i>Fellow Countrymen</i>&mdash;At this second appearing to
take the oath of the Presidential office, there is less
occasion for an extended address than there was at
the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a
course to be pursued seemed very fitting and proper.
Now, at the expiration of four years, during which
public declarations have been constantly called forth
on every point and phase of the great contest which
still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies
of the nation, little that is new could be presented.</p>

<p>The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly
depends is as well known to the public as to myself,
and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging
to all. With high hope for the future, no
prediction in regard to it is ventured.</p>

<p>On the occasion corresponding to this four years
ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending
civil war. All dreaded it; all sought to
avoid it. While the inaugural address was being delivered
from this place, devoted altogether to saving
the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the
city seeking to destroy it without war&mdash;seeking to dissolve
the Union and divide the effects by negotiation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would
make war rather than let the nation survive, and the
other would accept war rather than let it perish, and
the war came.</p>

<p>One-eighth of the whole population were colored
slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but
localized in the Southern part of it. These slaves constituted
a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew
that this interest was somehow the cause of the war.
To strengthen, perpetuate and extend this interest,
was the object for which the insurgents would rend
the Union even by war, while the Government claimed
no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement
of it.</p>

<p>Neither party expected for the war the magnitude
or the duration which it has already attained. Neither
anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease
with, or even before the conflict itself should cease.
Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less
fundamental and astounding.</p>

<p>Both read the same Bible and prayed to the same
God, and each invoke his aid against the other. It
may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a
just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the
sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that
we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be
answered. That of neither has been answered fully.
The Almighty has his own purposes. 'Woe unto the
world because of offences, for it must needs be that
offences come: but woe to that man by whom the offence
cometh.' If we shall suppose that American
slavery is one of these offences, which in the providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
of God must needs come, but which having continued
through his appointed time, He now wills to remove,
and that he gives to both North and South this
terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the
offence came, shall we discern therein any departure
from those divine attributes which the believers in a
living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we
hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge
of war may soon pass away. Yet, if God wills that
it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's
two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be
sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the
lash shall be paid with another drawn with the sword,
as was said three thousand years ago; so, still it must
be said, 'The judgments of the Lord are true and
righteous altogether.'</p>

<p>With malice toward none, with charity for all, with
firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right,
let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind
up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have
borne the battle and for his widow and orphans, to do
all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting
peace among ourselves and with all nations."</p>

<p>The words of Lincoln seemed to grow more clear
and more remarkable as they approached the end.
Perhaps in no language, ancient or modern, are any
number of words found more touching and eloquent
than his speech of November 19, 1863, at the Gettysburg
celebration. He wrote it in a few moments,
while on the way to the celebration, on being told
that he would be expected to make some remarks, and
after Mr. Everett's oration he rose and read it. It was
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
"Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought
forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
created equal. Now, we are engaged in a great civil
war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so
conceived and dedicated, can long endure. We are
met on a great battle-field of that war. We have
come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final
resting-place for those who here gave their lives that
the nation might live. It is altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this.</p>

<p>But in a larger sense, <i>we</i> cannot dedicate, <i>we</i> cannot
consecrate, <i>we</i> cannot hallow, this ground. The brave
men, living and dead, who struggled here, <i>have</i> consecrated
it far above our poor power to add or detract. The
world will little note, nor long remember what we <i>say</i>
here, but it can never forget what they <i>did</i> here. It is for
us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have thus far
so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that
from these honored dead, we take increased devotion
to that cause for which they gave the last full measure
of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation,
under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and
that government <i>of</i> the people, <i>by</i> the people, and <i>for</i>
the people, shall not perish from the earth."</p>

<p>The audience had admired Mr. Everett's long
address. At Mr. Lincoln's few words, they cheered
and sobbed and wept. When Mr. Lincoln had
ended, he turned and congratulated Mr. Everett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
on having succeeded so well. Mr. Everett replied,
with a truthful and real compliment, "Ah, Mr. Lincoln,
how gladly I would exchange all my hundred
pages, to have been the author of your twenty lines!"</p>

<p>Probably no ruler ever made a more profoundly
and peculiarly <i>Christian</i> impression on the mind of the
world than Lincoln. In his religious faith two leading
ideas were prominent from first to last&mdash;man's
helplessness, both as to strength and wisdom, and God's
helpfulness in both. When he left Springfield to assume
the Presidency, he said to his townsmen:</p>

<p>"A duty devolves on me which is perhaps greater
than that which has devolved on any other man since the
days of Washington. He never would have succeeded
but for the aid of divine Providence, on which he
at all times relied, and I feel that I cannot succeed
without the same Divine aid which sustained him.
On the same Almighty Being I place my reliance for
support, and I hope that you, my friends, will pray
that I may receive that Divine assistance, without
which I cannot succeed, but with which success is certain."</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln's whole course showed that he
possessed that faith without which, St. Paul says, it is
impossible to please God, for "he that cometh to God
<i>must believe that He</i> <span class="smcap smaller">IS</span>, and that He is a <i>rewarder of
those who diligently seek him</i>."</p>

<p>And now our Christian pilgrim having passed
through the valley of the shadow of death, and slain
and vanquished giants and dragons, at last had a little
taste, a few days sojourn, in the land of Beulah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Cheer after cheer rose up and shook the land as by
one great stroke after another the awful convulsions
of the conflict terminated in full, perfect, final victory.</p>

<p>Never did mortal man on this earth have a triumph
more dramatic and astounding than Lincoln's victorious
entry into Richmond. Years before, when a
humble lawyer in Illinois, a man without prestige of
person or manners or education, he had espoused
what the world called the losing side, and been content
to take the up-hill, laborious road. He had seen
his rival, adorned with every external advantage of
person, manners, eloquence and oratory, sweeping all
prizes away from him, and far distancing him in the
race of political ambition.</p>

<p>In those days, while confessing that he had felt the
promptings of ambition, and the disappointment of
ill success, there was one manly and noble sentiment
that ought to be printed in letters of gold, as the
motto of every rising young man. Speaking of the
distinction at which Douglas was aiming, he said:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">So reached as that the oppressed of my species
might have equal reason to rejoice with me,
I should value it more than the proudest crown
that could deck the brow of a monarch.</span>"</p>

<p>At this moment of his life he could look back and
see far behind him the grave of the once brilliant
Douglas, who died worn out and worn down with disappointed
ambition, while he, twice elected to the
Presidency, was now standing the observed of all the
world, in a triumph that has no like in history.
And it was a triumph made memorable and peculiar
by the ecstacies and hallelujahs of those very oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
with whose care years before he had weighted and
burdened his progress. It was one of those earthly
scenes which grandly foreshadow that great final triumph
predicted in prophecy, when the Lord God
shall wipe away all tears from all faces, and the rebuke
of his people shall he utterly take away. A cotemporary
witness has described Lincoln, calm and simple,
leading his little boy by the hand, while the liberated
blacks hailed him with hymns and prayers, mingling
his name at each moment with ascriptions of praise
and glory to Jesus the Great Liberator, whose day at
last had come. Who can say of what ages of mournful
praying and beseeching, what uplifting of poor,
dumb hands that hour was the outcome? Years before,
a clergyman of Virginia visiting the black insurrectionist,
Nat Turner, in his cell before execution,
gives the following wonderful picture of him: "In
rags, in chains, covered with blood and bruises, he
yet is inspired by such a force of enthusiasm, as he
lifts his chained hands to heaven, as really filled my soul
with awe. It is impossible to make him feel that he is
guilty. He evidently believes that he was called of
God to do the work he did. When I pointed out to
him that it could not be, because he was taken, condemned,
and about to be executed, he answered with
enthusiasm, 'Was not Jesus Christ crucified? My
cause <i>will</i> succeed yet!'"</p>

<p>Years passed, and the prophetic visions of Nat Turner
were fulfilled on the soil of Virginia. It did indeed
rain blood; the very leaves of the trees dripped
blood; but the work was <i>done</i>, the yoke was broken,
and the oppressed went free. An old negress who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
stood and saw the confederate prisoners being carried
for safe keeping into the former slave pens, said grimly,
"Well, de Lord am slow, but He am <i>sure</i>!"</p>

<p>As the final scenes of his life drew on, it seemed as
if a heavenly influence overshadowed the great martyr,
and wrought in him exactly the spirit that a man
would wish to be found in when he is called to the
eternal world. His last expressions and recorded political
actions looked towards peace and forgiveness.
On the day before his death he joyfully ordered the
discontinuance of the draft. His very last official act
was to give orders that two of the chief leaders
of the rebellion, then expected in disguise at a
sea port, on their flight to Europe, should not be
arrested, but permitted to embark; so that he was
thinking only of saving the lives of rebels, when
they were thinking of taking his. If he had tried of
set purpose to clear his soul for God's presence, and
to put the rebels and their assassin champion in the
wrong before that final tribunal, he could not have
done better.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln seems to have had during his course a
marked presentiment of the fate which had from the
first been threatening him, and which the increasing
pile of letters marked "Assassination," gave him constant
reason to remember. In more than one instance
he had in his public speeches professed a solemn willingness
to die for his principles. The great tax
which his labors and responsibilities made on his vitality,
was perhaps one reason for his frequently saying
that he felt that he should not live to go through
with it. He observed to Mr. Lovejoy, during that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
gentleman's last illness, in February, 1864, "This war
is eating my life out; I have a strong impression that
I shall not live to see the end." In July following,
he said to a correspondent of the Boston Journal, "I
feel a presentiment that I shall not outlast the rebellion.
When it is over, my work will be done."</p>

<p>Concerning the last painful history, there have been
a thousand conflicting stories. From the mass of evidence
the following brief account has been prepared,
which sufficiently outlines the circumstances:</p>

<p>Who were the persons concerned in the assassination
of President Lincoln, has never been judicially
proved. Perhaps it never will be. The indictment
against the conspirators named the following parties.
David E. Herold, George A. Atzerodt, Lewis Payne,
Michael O'Laughlin, Edward Spangler, Samuel Arnold,
Mary E. Surratt, Samuel A. Mudd, John H.
Surratt, John Wilkes Booth, Jefferson Davis, George
N. Sanders, Beverly Tucker, Jacob Thompson, William
C. Cleary, Clement C. Clay, George Harper, and
George Young; and it added, "and others unknown."
The assassin was John Wilkes Booth. And whether
or no Jefferson Davis and his fellows in the rebel government
were actually aiding and abetting in this
particular crime, it has not been unjust nor unnatural
to suspect them of it. For Mr. Davis certainly accredited
Thompson, Sanders, Clay, and Tucker, as his
official agents in Canada. These men in their turn,
and acting in harmony with their instructions and the
purposes of their government, gave a commission to
that John A. Kennedy who was detected in attempting
to kindle an extensive fire in the city of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
York, and consulted with him about his proposed
plans. This was the substance of Kennedy's own confession,
and he and his accomplices did kindle fires in
four of the New York hotels. It is completely proved,
again, that Davis paid sundry sums, in all $35,000
in gold, to incendiaries hired by his government to
burn hospitals and steamboats at the West, and that
Thompson paid money to a person engaged in Dr.
Blackburn's attempt to spread yellow fever in our
cities.</p>

<p>But more: when one Alston wrote to Davis, offering
his services to try to "rid my country of some of
her deadliest enemies, by striking at the very heart's
blood of those who seek to enchain her in slavery"&mdash;adding
the very significant remark, "I consider nothing
dishonorable having such a tendency," Mr. Davis
caused this proposition not to be refused, nor passed
over in silence, nor indignantly exposed; but to be
"respectfully referred, by direction of the President,
to the honorable Secretary of War." Still more: it
has been proved that in 1863, John Wilkes Booth
declared that "Abraham Lincoln must be killed."
The rebel agents in Canada, six months before the
assassination, specifically made the same declaration.
In the summer of 1864, Thompson said that he could
at any time have the "tyrant Lincoln," or any of his
advisers that he chose, "put out of the way," and
that Thompson's agents would not consider doing this
a crime, if done for the rebel cause; and Clay, when
he heard of this, corroborated the sentiment, saying,
"That is so; we are all devoted to our cause, and
ready to go any length&mdash;to do anything under the
sun." Many other such utterances by rebel leaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
are proved and have become uncontradicted matter of
history. Besides; when Mr. Davis, at Charlotte, North
Carolina, while fleeing from Richmond, received the
telegram announcing the fate of Mr. Lincoln, he calmly
read it aloud to the people present, and without a
word of disapproval, uttered a cold comment: "If it
were to be done, it were better it were well done."
And when Breckinridge said he regretted it, (not because
it was wicked or dishonorable, but because it
was unfortunate for the South just then,) Mr Davis
replied in the same tone of cold indifference or of
concealed satisfaction, and using the same words:
"Well, General, I don't know; if it were to be done
at all, it were better that it were well done; and if the
same had been done to Andy Johnson, the Beast (i. e.
Gen. Butler), and to Secretary Stanton, the job would
then be complete." Those are not the words of an
honorable man, nor of a disapprover. But they are
exactly natural to an accessory before the fact, who
does not confess his part in it, and prefers to dissemble
his joy. It is not at all unreasonable to suspect that
the men who are proved to have done thus and spoken
thus, before and after the deed, and who have openly
hired and approved the perpetration of such other
deeds, were concerned in the planning and execution
of this deed too.</p>

<p>Booth was an actor, and the son of a well known
actor; and the son had inherited, apparently, much
of the reckless and occasionally furious temper of his
father. He was also a very violent and bitter rebel.
During the fall of 1864, he had been in Canada, consulting
with the rebel agents there, and mixed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
with a number of other subordinate agents in the business
of assassinating President Lincoln; and he was
the most prominent candidate, so to speak, for the
place of actual murderer. On November 11th, 1864,
he was in New York, where, while riding with a companion
in a street car, he dropped a letter which came
into the possession of the government; it was a vigorous
appeal to him to assassinate Mr. Lincoln. It
said: "Abe must die, and now. You can choose your
weapons, the cup, the knife, the bullet;" and again:
"Strike for your home, strike for your country; bide
your time, but strike sure." During the winter,
Booth was engaging the assistance required for his
scheme; and he had already fixed upon the scene of
the murder; for, not later than January, he was urging
one Chester to enter into the plan, and assuring him
that all his part of it would be to stand at the back
door of Ford's Theatre and open it. This was a safe
calculation, for the President's enjoyment of dramatic
performances was great, and enhanced by the difficulty
of finding agreeable relaxations, and also by the
awful pressure of his official duties and of the war,
which intensified the need of relaxation.</p>

<p>The scheme as finally arranged, provided for the assassination
of Mr. Lincoln, by Booth; of Mr. Johnson,
by Atzerodt; of Mr. Seward, by Payne, (alias Powell);
and of Gen. Grant, by O'Laughlin. For the President,
an elaborate death trap was constructed in Ford's
Theatre. The catches of the locks to all three doors
of the President's box (one outer and two inner ones),
were loosened by loosening their screws, and left so
that a slight push would enable the assassin to enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
even though the doors should be locked. A small
hole was made through one of the two inner ones, to
enable him to see before entering exactly how his victim
sat, so that the final moves within the box could
be laid out before entering it; and a wooden brace
was prepared to set against the outer door (which
opened inward) with one end, and with the other to
fit a mortice cut in the wall behind, so that after entering,
the assassin could fasten the door behind him
sufficiently to prevent any interruption until his work
was done. Arrangements were made for securing
horses for the murderers to flee with. The stage carpenter
or assistant, Spangler, was employed to be on
hand and open and shut the back door of the theatre
when wanted. Some scenes and miscellaneous matter
that frequently impeded more or less the passage from
the front of the stage to this back door, were piled up
or otherwise put out of the way. A supply of weapons
for the conspirators was provided. And a route
for flight from Washington within the rebel lines was
determined on. This route led southward from the
city, over Anacostia Bridge, ten miles to Mrs. Surratt's
house at Surrattsville, then some fifteen miles more to
Dr. Mudd's house, then about twenty miles to a point
where arrangements were made for crossing the Potomac
and proceeding towards Richmond.</p>

<p>All being ready, Booth, about 9 P.&nbsp;M., on the 14th
of April, 1865, went to the theatre. He first went to
the back door, entered it and saw that all was prepared;
left Spangler in charge, and left his horse to
be held by another subordinate of the theatre. Then
he went round to the front of the building, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
three of the conspirators were waiting. It was now
about half past nine. One act of the play, "Our
American Cousin,"&mdash;was nearly through. "I think he
will come out now," remarked Booth. It is very
usual for the spectators to leave the theatre between
the acts, often to return; and if Mr. Lincoln had happened
to feel too busy to remain longer and had left
then, probably Booth would have attacked him there,
trusting to be able to escape into the theatre in the
bustle and so through his guarded door. But the
President did not come. Booth went into a saloon
close by and drank some whisky. The spectators had
returned for the next act. Booth entered the vestibule
of the theatre, and from it the passage that leads
from the street to the stage and also to the outer door
of the President's box. As he did so, one of his companions
followed him into the vestibule, looked up to
the clock and called out the hour. It was approaching
ten. Three successive times, at intervals of several
minutes, the companion thus called out the hour.
The third time he called, in a louder tone, "Ten minutes
past ten o'clock!" At this Booth disappeared in
the theatre, and the three others walked rapidly away.
Booth went straight to the outer door of the President's
box, paused and showed a visiting card to the
President's messenger, who was in waiting; placed his
hand and his knee against the door, and pushing it
open, entered. He then quietly fastened the door
with the brace that stood ready; looked through the
hole in the inner door, and saw the President. Silently
opening the door, he entered. Mr. Lincoln sat at
the left hand front corner of the box, his wife at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
right hand, a Miss Harris at the right hand front corner,
and a Major Rathbone behind her. Mr. Lincoln
was leaning forward and looking down into the orchestra.
Booth stepped quickly up, and fired a pistol
bullet into the President's head, behind and on the
left side. The murdered man raised his head once; it
fell back upon his chair, and his eyes closed. Major
Rathbone, a cool, bold and prompt soldier, who had
been absorbed in the play, now hearing the pistol-shot,
turned, saw Booth through the smoke, and instantly
sprang upon him. Booth, a nervous and strong man,
expert in all athletic exercises, and a skillful fencer,
wrenched himself free with a desperate effort, as he
well needed to do. He had already dropped his pistol
and drawn a heavy bowie knife, with which he made
a furious thrust at his captor's heart. Rathbone parried
it, but was wounded deeply in the arm and his hold
loosed. Booth sprang for the front of the box; Rathbone
followed, but only caught his clothes as he sprang
over. Rathbone shouted "Stop that man!" and then
turned to assist the President.</p>

<p>Booth leaped over the front of the box, down upon
the stage, shouting as he went, "Revenge for the
South!" His spur caught in the national flag as he
descended; the entanglement caused him to fall almost
flat on the stage as he came down; and either the
wrench of tearing loose from the flag, or the fall,
snapped one of the bones of his leg between knee and
ankle. This fracture, though not preventing him at
once from moving about, so far disabled him as probably
to have been the occasion of his being overtaken
and captured; so that it is scarcely extravagant to imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
the flag as having, in a sense, avenged the guilt
of the crime perpetrated upon its chief official defender,
by waylaying and entrapping the criminal in
his turn, as he had done his victim. Booth instantly
sprang up, turned towards the audience, and raising
his bloody knife in a stage attitude, with a theatrical
manner, vociferated the motto of the State of Virginia,
"<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sic semper tyrannis!</i>"&mdash;a motto already turned
into a discreditable satire by its contrast with the characteristic
traffic of the great slavebreeding state, and
even more effectually disgraced by the use now made
of it, to justify assassination. It will be strange if
some less dishonored words are not one day chosen
for the device of Free Virginia.</p>

<p>Booth, thus vaporing for a moment, then rushed
headlong across the stage, and darted by the side passage
to the rear door. One man sprang from an
orchestra seat upon the stage and shouted to stop him.
One of the employes of the theatre, standing in the
passage, was too much startled to stand aside, and the
desperate fugitive struck him on the leg, cut at him
twice, knocked him one side and darted on. The door
was ready. He sprang out, and it shut behind him.
Seizing the horse which was held in waiting for him,
Booth, as if in a frenzy like that of the Malays when
"running <i>amok</i>," struck the poor fellow who held it,
with the butt of his knife, knocking him down; and
then kicking him, sprang to the saddle, and after a
few moments lost in consequence of some nervousness
or fright of the animal, rode swiftly off. This was on
the evening of Friday, the 14th; it was on Wednesday,
the 26th, that Booth, after having been delayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
by having his leg set, and crippled by it afterwards,
was discovered in Garrett's barn, south of the Rappahannock,
not far from twenty miles from the Potomac,
and was surrounded, shot and taken.</p>

<p>The murdered President was quickly carried from
the theatre to a house across the street and placed
upon a bed. Surgical aid was at once obtained, but
an examination at once showed that there was no hope
of life. Mr. Lincoln's eyes had not opened, nor had
consciousness returned at all, and they never did. The
ball was a heavy one, from what is called a Derringer
pistol, a short single-barreled weapon with a large
bore. It had passed clear through the brain, and
lodged against the bone of the orbit of the left eye,
breaking that bone. It is almost certain that Mr.
Lincoln suffered no pain after being shot, as the injury
was of a nature to destroy conscious life. His
exceedingly strong constitution and tenacity of life
maintained respiration and circulation for a remarkably
long time, but he died the next morning at about
half past seven.</p>

<p>Of the particulars of that great national mourning
which bowed the whole land, it is not needful to speak.
Like many parts of that great history of which it
formed a portion, there were often points in it of a
peculiar and symbolic power, which rose to the sublime.
Such was the motto&mdash;"Be still, and know that
I am God"&mdash;which spoke from the walls of the New
York depot when amid the hush of weeping thousands,
the solemn death car entered. The contrast between
the peaceful expression on the face of the weary man,
and the surging waves of mourning and lamentation
around him was touching and awful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Not the least touching among these expressions of
national mourning was the dismay and anguish of that
poor oppressed race for whose rights he died.</p>

<p>A southern correspondent of the New York Tribune,
the week following the assassination, wrote:
"I never saw such sad faces, or heard such heavy
heart-beatings, as here in Charleston the day the news
came. The colored people were like children bereaved
of a parent. I saw one old woman going up
the streets, wringing her hands, and saying aloud as
she walked, looking straight before her, so absorbed
in her grief that she noticed no one;</p>

<p>'O Lord! Oh Lord! O Lord! Massa Sam's dead!
Massa Sam's dead!'</p>

<p>'Who's dead, Aunty?' 'Massa Sam's dead!' she
said, not looking at me, and renewing her lamentations.</p>

<p>'Who's Massa Sam?' said I.</p>

<p>'Uncle Sam,' she said, 'O Lord! O Lord!'</p>

<p>Not quite sure that she meant the President, I spoke
again:</p>

<p>'Who's Massa Sam, Aunty?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Lincum!' she said, and resumed wringing her
hands, mourning in utter hopelessness of sorrow."</p>

<p>The poor negroes on the distant plantations had
formed a conception of Lincoln, much akin to that of a
Divine Being. Their masters fled on the approach of
our soldiers, and this gave the slaves the conception
of a great Invisible Power which they called Massa
Lincum. An old negro exhorter once, rising in an
assembly of them, was heard solemnly instructing his
fellows in the nature of this great unknown: "Bredren,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
he said solemnly, "Massa Lincum, he be eberywhere.
He knows ebery ting;" and looking up solemnly,
"He walk de earf like de Lord."</p>

<p>To them the stroke was almost as if we could possibly
conceive death as happening to the God we worship;
a mingled shock of grief, surprise and terror.</p>

<p>No death of a public man ever entered so deep into
the life of individual families, so as to seem like a personal
domestic sorrow. The assumption of mourning
badges and garments, the hanging out of mourning
tokens, was immediate in thousands of families, each
obeying the same spontaneous impulse without stopping
to consult the other. It seemed almost as if the
funeral bells tolled of themselves and without hands.
Wherever the news travelled, so immediately and
without waiting for public consultation, were these
tributes of mourning given.</p>

<p>One fact alone, proves the depth and strength of
these feelings more than volumes of description. It
is, the vast extent of the publications in which the
history of Mr. Lincoln's life and times, his individual
biography and real or written utterances, or his personal
appearance, were in one way or another commemorated.
A gentleman who has begun a collection
of such materials had some time ago gathered two
hundred different books on Mr. Lincoln, a hundred
and twenty-five portraits, besides badges, mourning
cards, autographs and manuscripts, as he reports,
"almost without number." And in the list of publications
about the rebellion compiled by Mr. Bartlett,
are enumerated three hundred and eighty books, sermons,
eulogies or addresses upon his life or death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
There is an astonishing contrast between the perfect
sweetness and kindness of Mr. Lincoln's sentiments
and utterances, whether private or public, individual
or official, in reference to the rebels and the rebellion,
and theirs about him. Doubtless no loyal citizen
of the United States was so uniformly kind in
feeling and decorous and even courteous in expression,
about the rebels; and doubtless no such citizen
was so odiously bespattered with the most hateful and
vulgar and ferocious insult and abuse, both public and
private. To give the quotations to prove the point
would be simply disgusting. They were sprinkled
through the newspapers and the public documents of
the rebellion from beginning to end of it. A compend
and a proof at once of the whole of them was
that private bundle of letters threatening death,
marked in Mr. Lincoln's own handwriting "Assassination,"
and kept in his private cabinet. And the assassination
itself and the circumstances connected with
it, constituted another proof and specimen, still more
overwhelming. Never since the times of the Christian
martyrs has history recorded a contrast more humiliating
to humanity, between his kind words and kind
intentions on the one hand, and infamous abusiveness
and deliberate bloodthirsty ferocity in those who
thus slew the best and kindest friend they had in the
world.</p>

<p>Scarcely less striking was the contrast between the
habitual tone of the foreign utterances about President
Lincoln before his death and that of those after
it; a change, moreover, whose promptness and evident
manly good faith may in some measure atone for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the unreasonable and even indecent character of many
things said and printed in Europe. It is unnecessary
to reproduce the offences: it is a more grateful task to
quote a few specimens of the feelings and expressions
with which the news of his death and of the manner
of it was received abroad.</p>

<p>It may be premised, that some few persons of foreign
birth and good position, had already discerned
the truth of the character of Mr. Lincoln. A correspondent
of the N.&nbsp;Y. Times wrote that paper from
Washington, on one occasion, the following narrative:</p>

<p>"One day, as President Lincoln drove past a Washington
hotel, sitting alone in his carriage, three gentlemen
stood talking in front of the hotel. One of
them, a foreigner of high cultivation and great distinction,
with a gesture quite involuntary, raised his
hat and remained uncovered until Mr. Lincoln had
passed by. One of his companions, surprised at so
much ceremony, observed, "You forget that you are
in republican America and not in Russia." "Not at
all, sir&mdash;not at all," was the reply, given with a
certain indignation; "that is the only living ruler
whom I sincerely reverence. I could not avoid showing
the feeling, if I would. He is a patriot, a statesman,
a great-hearted honest man. You Americans
reverence nothing in the present." And after a few
more sentences to the like effect, he ended by saying:
"Not only your posterity, but the posterity of all the
peoples which love honesty and revere patriotism, will
declare that the part which President Lincoln was
called to perform, required the exercise of as noble
qualities as the 'Father of his Country' ever possessed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
It is any thing but a credit to you that you
do not better appreciate the man whom God has sent
in these perilous times to rule the people of this republic."</p>

<p>The rebuke was received in silence. But such
cases were very few. The general tone of foreign
opinion about him was thoroughly unjust. Not so the
obituary testimonials from across the sea.</p>

<p>On the first of May, 1865, Sir George Grey, in the
English House of Commons, moved an address to the
Crown, to express the feelings of the House upon the
assassination of Mr. Lincoln. In this address he said
that he was convinced that Mr. Lincoln "in the hour
of victory, and in the triumph of victory, would have
shown that wise forbearance, and that generous consideration,
which would have added tenfold lustre to
the fame that he had already acquired, amidst the varying
fortunes of the war."</p>

<p>In seconding the same address, at the same time and
place, Mr. Benjamin Disraeli said: "But in the character
of the victim, and in the very accessories of his almost
latest moments, there is something so homely and so
innocent that it takes the subject, as it were, out of
the pomp of history, and out of the ceremonial of diplomacy.
It touches the heart of nations, and appeals
to the domestic sentiments of mankind."</p>

<p>In the House of Lords, Lord John Russell, in moving
a similar address, observed: "President Lincoln
was a man who, although he had not been distinguished
before his election, had from that time displayed
a character of so much integrity, sincerity and
straightforwardness, and at the same time of so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
kindness, that if any one could have been able to alleviate
the pain and animosity which have prevailed
during the civil war, I believe President Lincoln was
the man to have done so." And again, in speaking
of the question of amending the constitution so as to
prohibit slavery, he said: "We must all feel that there
again the death of President Lincoln deprives the
United States of the man who was the leader on this
subject."</p>

<p>Mr. John Stuart Mill, the distinguished philosopher,
in a letter to an American friend, used far stronger
expressions than these guarded phrases of high
officials. He termed Mr. Lincoln "the great citizen
who had afforded so noble an example of the qualities
befitting the first magistrate of a free people, and who,
in the most trying circumstances, had gradually won
not only the admiration, but almost the personal affection
of all who love freedom or appreciate simplicity
or uprightness."</p>

<p>Professor Goldwin Smith, writing to the London
Daily News, began by saying, "It is difficult to measure
the calamity which the United States and the
world have sustained by the murder of President Lincoln.
The assassin has done his best to strike down
mercy and moderation, of both of which this good
and noble life was the main stay."</p>

<p>Senhor Rebello da Silva, a member of the Portuguese
Chamber of Peers, in moving a resolution on the
death of Mr. Lincoln, thus outlined his character:
"He is truly great who rises to the loftiest heights
from profound obscurity, relying solely on his own
merits as did Napoleon, Washington, Lincoln. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
these arose to power and greatness, not through any
favor or grace, by a chance cradle, or genealogy, but
through the prestige of their own deeds, through the
nobility which begins and ends with themselves&mdash;the
sole offspring of their own works. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Lincoln
was of this privileged class; he belonged to this aristocracy.
In infancy, his energetic soul was nourished
by poverty. In youth, he learned through toil the
love of liberty, and respect for the rights of man.
Even to the age of twenty-two, educated in adversity,
his hands made callous by honorable labor, he rested
from the fatigues of the field, spelling out, in the pages
of the Bible, in the lessons of the gospel, in the
fugitive leaves of the daily journal&mdash;which the aurora
opens, and the night disperses&mdash;the first rudiments of
instruction, which his solitary meditations ripened.
The chrysalis felt one day the ray of the sun, which
called it to life, broke its involucrum, and it launched
forth fearlessly from the darkness of its humble cloister
into the luminous spaces of its destiny. The farmer,
day-laborer, shepherd, like Cincinnatus, left the
plough-share in the half-broken furrow, and, legislator
of his own State, and afterwards of the Great Republic,
saw himself proclaimed in the tribunal the popular
chief of several millions of people, the maintainer of
the holy principle inaugurated by Wilberforce."</p>

<p>There are some vague and some only partially correct
statements in this diffuse passage; but it shows
plainly enough how enthusiastically the Portuguese nobleman
had admired the antique simplicity and
strength of Mr. Lincoln's character.</p>

<p>Dr. Merle d'Aubigne, the historian of the Reformation,
writing to Mr. Fogg, U.&nbsp;S. Minister to Switzerland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
said: "While not venturing to compare him to
the great sacrifice of Golgotha, which gave liberty to
the captives, is it not just, in this hour, to recall the
word of an apostle (1 John, iii: 16): 'Hereby perceive
we the love of God, because he laid down his
life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for
the brethren'? Who can say that the President did
not lay down his life by the firmness of his devotion
to a great duty? The name of Lincoln will remain
one of the greatest that history has to inscribe on its
annals. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Among the legacies which Lincoln
leaves to us, we shall all regard as the most precious,
his spirit of equity, of moderation, and of peace, according
to which he will still preside, if I may so
speak, over the restoration of your great nation."</p>

<p>The "Democratic Association" of Florence, addressed
"to the Free People of the United States," a
letter, in which they term Mr. Lincoln "the honest,
the magnanimous citizen, the most worthy chief magistrate
of your glorious Federation."</p>

<p>The eminent French liberal, M. Edouard Laboulaye,
in a speech showing a remarkably just understanding
and extremely broad views with respect to the affairs
and the men of the United States, said: "Mr. Lincoln
was one of those heroes who are ignorant of themselves;
his thoughts will reign after him. The name
of Washington has already been pronounced, and I
think with reason. Doubtless Mr. Lincoln resembled
Franklin more than Washington. By his origin, his
arch good nature, his ironical good sense, and his love
of anecdotes and jesting, he was of the same blood as
the printer of Philadelphia. But it is nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
true that in less than a century, America has passed
through two crises in which its liberty might have
been lost, if it had not had honest men at its head;
and that each time it has had the happiness to meet
the man best fitted to serve it. If Washington founded
the Union, Lincoln has saved it. History will draw
together and unite those two names. A single word
explains Mr. Lincoln's whole life: it was Duty. Never
did he put himself forward; never did he think of
himself; never did he seek one of those ingenious
combinations which puts the head of a state in bold
relief, and enhances his importance at the expense
of the country; his only ambition, his only thought
was faithfully to fulfil the mission which his fellow-citizens
had entrusted to him. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* His inaugural
address, March 4, 1865, shows us what progress
had been made in his soul. This piece of familiar
eloquence is a master-piece; it is the testament of a
patriot. I do not believe that any eulogy of the
President would equal this page on which he has depicted
himself in all his greatness and all his simplicity.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* History is too often only a school of
immorality. It shows us the victory of force or stratagem
much more than the success of justice, moderation,
and probity. It is too often only the apotheosis
of triumphant selfishness. There are noble and great
exceptions; happy those who can increase the number,
and thus bequeath a noble and beneficent example to
posterity! Mr. Lincoln is among these. He would
willingly have repeated, after Franklin, that 'falsehood
and artifice are the practice of fools who have
not wit enough to be honest.' All his private life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
and all his political life, were inspired and directed by
this profound faith in the omnipotence of virtue. It
is through this, again, that he deserves to be compared
with Washington; it is through this that he will remain
in history with the most glorious name that can
be merited by the head of a free people&mdash;a name
given him by his cotemporaries, and which will be
preserved to him by posterity&mdash;that of Honest Abraham
Lincoln."</p>

<p>A letter from the well known French historian,
Henri Martin, to the Paris Siècle, contained the following
passages: "Lincoln will remain the austere
and sacred personification of a great epoch, the most
faithful expression of democracy. This simple and
upright man, prudent and strong, elevated step by
step from the artizan's bench to the command of a
great nation, and always without parade and without
effort, at the height of his position; executing without
precipitation, without flourish, and with invincible
good sense, the most colossal acts; giving to the world
this decisive example of the civil power in a republic;
directing a gigantic war, without free institutions being
for an instant compromised or threatened by military
usurpation; dying, finally, at the moment when,
after conquering, he was intent on pacification, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
this man will stand out, in the traditions of his
country and the world, as an incarnation of the people,
and of modern democracy itself. The great work
of emancipation had to be sealed, therefore, with the
blood of the just, even as it was inaugurated with the
blood of the just. The tragic history of the abolition
of slavery, which opened with the gibbet of John
Brown, will close with the assassination of Lincoln.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
And now let him rest by the side of Washington,
as the second founder of the great Republic. European
democracy is present in spirit at his funeral, as
it voted in its heart for his re-election, and applauded
the victory in the midst of which he passed away. It
will wish with one accord to associate itself with the
monument that America will raise to him upon the
capitol of prostrate slavery."</p>

<p>The London Globe, in commenting on Mr. Lincoln's
assassination, said that he "had come nobly through a
great ordeal. He had extorted the admiration even of
his opponents, at least on this side of the water. They
had come to admire, reluctantly, his firmness, honesty,
fairness and sagacity. He tried to do, and had done,
what he considered his duty, with magnanimity."</p>

<p>The London Express said, "He had tried to show
the world how great, how moderate, and how true he
could be, in the moment of his great triumph."</p>

<p>The Liverpool Post said, "If ever there was a man
who in trying times avoided offenses, it was Mr. Lincoln.
If there ever was a leader in a civil contest who
shunned acrimony and eschewed passion, it was he.
In a time of much cant and affectation he was simple,
unaffected, true, transparent. In a season of many
mistakes he was never known to be wrong. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
By a happy tact, not often so felicitously blended with
pure evidence of soul, Abraham Lincoln knew when
to speak, and never spoke too early or too late. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
The memory of his statesmanship, translucent in the
highest degree, and above the average, and openly
faithful, more than almost any of this age has witnessed,
to fact and right, will live in the hearts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
minds of the whole Anglo-Saxon race, as one of the
noblest examples of that race's highest qualities. Add
to all this that Abraham Lincoln was the humblest
and pleasantest of men, that he had raised himself
from nothing, and that to the last no grain of conceit
or ostentation was found in him, and there stands before
the world a man whose like we shall not soon
look upon again."</p>

<p>In the remarks of M. Rouher, the French Minister,
in the Legislative Assembly, on submitting to that Assembly
the official despatch of the French Foreign
Minister to the Chargé at Washington, M. Rouher remarked,
of Mr. Lincoln's personal character, that he
had exhibited "that calm firmness and indomitable
energy which belong to strong minds, and are the
necessary conditions of the accomplishment of great
duties. In the hour of victory he exhibited generosity,
moderation and conciliation."</p>

<p>And in the despatch, which was signed by M. Drouyn
de L'Huys, were the following expressions: "Abraham
Lincoln exhibited, in the exercise of the power
placed in his hands, the most substantial qualities. In
him, firmness of character was allied to elevation of
principle. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* In reviewing these last testimonies
to his exalted wisdom, as well as the examples of
good sense, of courage, and of patriotism, which he
has given, history will not hesitate to place him in the
rank of citizens who have the most honored their
country."</p>

<p>In the Prussian Lower House, Herr Loewes, in
speaking of the news of the assassination, said that
Mr. Lincoln "performed his duties without pomp or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
ceremony, and relied on that dignity of his inner self
alone, which is far above rank, orders and titles. He
was a faithful servant, not less of his own commonwealth
than of civilization, freedom and humanity."</p>

<p>By far the most beautiful of all these foreign tributes,
was the very generous memorial of the London
Punch. That paper had joined all the fashionable
world in making merry at Lincoln's expense while he
struggled, weary and miry, through the "valley of
humiliation,"&mdash;but it is not every one who does a
wrong who is capable of so full and generous a reparation.
We give it entire, because, apart from its noble
spirit, it is one of the most truthful summaries of
Lincoln's character:</p>

<p>Lincoln must be looked upon in the final review of
his character, as one of those men elect of God, whom
he calls and chooses to effect great purposes of his
own, and fashions and educates with especial reference
to that purpose. As is usual in such cases, the man
whom God chooses for a work is not at all the man
whom the world beforehand would choose, and often
for a time the world has difficulty in receiving him.
There was great questioning about him in the diplomatic
circles of Europe, when the war began, and
there was great searching of heart concerning him at
home. There have been times when there were impatient
murmurs that another sort of man was wanted
in his chair&mdash;a man with more dash, more brilliancy,
more Napoleonic efficiency. Yet in the contest such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
a man might have been our ruin. A brilliant military
genius might have wrecked the republic on the rock
of military despotism, where so many good ships have
gone down; whereas, slow, cautious, honest old Abe
only took our rights of habeas corpus, and other civil
privileges, as he did the specie of old, to make the
legal tender, and brought it all back safe and sound.</p>

<p>Lincoln was a strong man, but his strength was of
a peculiar kind; it was not aggressive so much as
passive, and among passive things it was like the
strength not so much of a stone buttress as of a wire
cable. It was strength swaying to every influence,
yielding on this side and on that to popular needs,
yet tenaciously and inflexibly bound to carry its great
end. Probably by no other kind of strength could
our national ship have been drawn safely through so
dreadful a channel. Surrounded by all sorts of conflicting
claims, by traitors, by half-hearted, timid men,
by border State men and free State men, by radical
abolitionists and conservatives, he listened to all, heard
all, weighed all, and in his own time acted by his
own honest convictions in the fear of God, and thus
simply and purely he did the greatest work that has
been done in modern times.</p>

<p>When the perception of our late great military crisis
first came upon us, and we found ourselves engaged
in an actual and real war, our first inquiry was for our
General.</p>

<p>For years and years there had been only peace talk
and peace valuations in our market. There had, to
be sure, been some frontier skirmishing&mdash;a campaign
in Mexico, which drew off our more restless adventurers,
and gave our politicians a little of a smart, martial
air, in rounding their periods, and pointing their allusions.
We had played war in Mexico as we read romances,
and the principal interest of it was, after all,
confined to our very small regular army of some
twenty-five thousand men, where some got promotions
in consequence of the vacancies made in this or that
battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Gen. Scott won European renown and some laurels
in this country. We created an office of Lieutenant
General on purpose to do him honor; but the people,
after all, laughed in their sleeves, and irreverently
called our national hero "Old Fuss and Feathers;" a
nickname which went far to show that whatever his
talents in the field might be, he had not succeeded in
establishing over the body of his countrymen the
ascendency which strong minds hold over weak ones.</p>

<p>But when the hour of our trial came we had to look
to him as our leader, and Gen. Scott accepted cheerfully
the situation, whose reality and magnitude neither
he nor we, nor any mortal living at that time, perceived,
or could estimate. Seward smiled in his cabinet
chair, and spoke of the affair as a little skirmish
that would be over in ninety days. A battle or two,
might occur, then an armistice, and then "We, Us and
Company" would walk in with our red tape and circumlocution
office, and tie up everything better than
before. So Scott spread his maps and talked cheerfully,
and the Washington cabinet congratulated one
another. "This is to be my last campaign," said
Scott, "and I mean it to be my best."</p>

<p>The country listened with earnest ears now to what
our chief military man said. When the father of a
family is lying between life and death, there is no
more laughing at the doctor&mdash;and in the solemn hush
that preceded <i>real</i> war, there was no more sneering at
old Fuss and Feathers. People wanted to believe in
him. They searched out his old exploits, talked of
his old successes, that they might hope and believe
that they had a deliverer and a leader in their midst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Slowly, surely, it began to appear through many a
defeat, many a disaster; through days and nights
when men's hearts failed them for fear, and for looking
for the things that were coming on the earth; through
all such signs and wonders as usher in great convulsions
of society&mdash;it began to be manifested that this
nation was in a contest for which there were no precedents,
which was to be as wide as from ocean to ocean,
which was to number its forces by millions, and for
which all former rules and ordinances of war, all records
of campaigns and battles, were as mere obsolete
ballads and old songs. The inquiry began to grow
more urgent: Who is to be our General?</p>

<p>General Scott professed that the work was too great
for him, but he called to his right hand and presented
to the nation one whom he delighted to honor, and
who was announced with songs and cheerings as the
young Napoleon of America.</p>

<p>The nation received him with acclamation. They
wanted a young Napoleon. A young Napoleon was
just what they needed, and a young Napoleon therefore
they were determined to believe that they had;
and for a while nothing was heard but his praises.
Every loyal paper was on its knees in humble expectancy,
to admire and to defend, but not to criticise.
Mothers were ready to send their sons to his banner;
millionaires offered the keys of their treasure chests
for his commissariat; the administration bowed to his
lightest suggestion, gave him all he asked, hung on
his lightest word. Everywhere he moved amid victorious
plaudits, the palms and honors of victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
everywhere credited to him in advance by the fond
faith of the whole nation.</p>

<p>We waited for victories. Our men were burning
with enthusiasm&mdash;begging, praying to be led to the
field, and yet nothing was done. "It takes time to
create an army," was the first announcement of our
chief. We gave him time, and he spent it in reviews,
in preparations, in fortifications and entrenchments.
The time he took gave the enemy just what they stood
in perishing need of&mdash;time to organize, concentrate,
drill, arrange with Europe, and get ready for a four
years' conflict.</p>

<p>It was God's will that we should have a four years'
war, and therefore when we looked for a leader he
sent us Gen. McClellan.</p>

<p>It was God's will that this nation&mdash;the North as
well as the South&mdash;should deeply and terribly suffer
for the sin of consenting to and encouraging the great
oppressions of the South; that the ill-gotten wealth
which had arisen from striking hands with oppression
and robbery, should be paid back in the taxes of war;
that the blood of the poor slave, that had cried so
many years from the ground in vain, should be answered
by the blood of the sons from the best hearth
stones through all the free States; that the slave
mothers, whose tears nobody regarded, should have
with them a great company of weepers, North and
South&mdash;Rachels weeping for their children and refusing
to be comforted; that the free States, who refused
to listen when they were told of lingering starvation,
cold, privation and barbarous cruelty, as perpetrated
on the slave, should have lingering starvation, cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
hunger and cruelty doing its work among their own
sons, at the hands of these slave masters, with whose
sins our nation had connived.</p>

<p>General McClellan was like those kings and leaders
we read of in the Old Testament, whom God sent to
a people with a purpose of wrath and punishment.</p>

<p>Slowly, through those dark days of rebuke and disaster,
did the people come at last to a consciousness that
they had trusted in vain&mdash;that such a continued series
of disasters were not exceptions and accidents, but
evidences of imbecility and incompetence in the governing
power.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the magnitude of this colossal war had
fully revealed itself&mdash;a war requiring combinations
and forces before unheard of, as different from those
of European battles as the prairies of the West differ
from Salisbury Plain, or the Mississippi from the
Thames&mdash;and we again feverishly asked, Where is our
leader?</p>

<p>We had faith that some man was to arise; but
where was he? Now one General, and now another
took the place of power, and we hoped and confided,
till disaster and reverses came and threw us on our
unanswered inquiry.</p>

<p>Now it is very remarkable that in all great crises
and convulsions of society, the man of the hour generally
comes from some obscure quarter&mdash;silently,
quietly, unannounced, unheralded, without prestige,
and makes his way alone and single-handed.</p>

<p>John the Baptist said to the awakened crowd, thrilling
with vague expectation of a coming Messiah,
"There standeth one among you whom ye know not,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and the same declaration might amount to a general
principle, which would hold good in most cases when
the wants of a new era in society call for a new leader.</p>

<p>When France lay convulsed after the terrible upheavings
of the French revolution, there was one man
strong enough to govern her, to bring back settled
society, law and order&mdash;but he was doing duty in an
obscure place as corporal of artillery; and in like
manner when the American war broke out, the General
who was to be strong enough, and wise enough,
and energetic enough to lead our whole army to victory,
was an obscure, silent, sensible man, who was
keeping a leather and saddle store in Galena, Ill.</p>

<p>He was a man principally to be noted for saying
little, and doing with certainty and completeness the
duty he happened to have in hand. If he failed in any
of the points required in a successful store-keeper in a
Western town, it was in the gift of talking. He had
no opinions on politics, no theories about the government
of the country, to put at the service of customers.
The petty squabbles of local politics he despised.
When one endeavored to engage him in a discussion
of some such matter, he is said to have answered:</p>

<p>"I don't know any thing of party politics, and I
don't want to. There is one subject on which I feel
perfectly at home. Talk to me of that and I shall be
happy to hear you."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"<i>Tanning leather.</i>"</p>

<p>Yet this quiet man, who confined his professions of
knowledge entirely to the business he took in hand,
was an educated man, who had passed with credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
through the military academy at West Point, graduated
with honor, been promoted for meritorious service
in the Mexican war to the rank of captain, and
whose powers of conversation, when he chooses to
converse on any subject befitting an educated man,
are said by those who know him best, to be quite
remarkable.</p>

<p>In these sketches of our distinguished men, we have,
whenever possible, searched somewhat into their pedigree;
for we have firm faith in the old maxim that
blood will tell.</p>

<p>It is interesting to know that there are authentic
documents existing, by which Gen. Grant's family may
be traced through a line of Puritan patriots far back
to England.</p>

<p>A gentleman in Hartford, justly celebrated for his
research in these matters, has kindly offered us the
following particulars:</p>

<p>"On the first page of a thick little memorandum
book which is now before me, well preserved in its
original sheepskin binding, are the following entries,
the obsolete spelling of which sufficiently attests their
antiquity:</p>

<p>May the 29 16. 45, Mathew Grant and Susanna ware
maried.</p>

<p>Mathew Grant was then three and fortey yeares of
age, seven moneths and eyghtene dayes; borne in the
yeare, 1601. October 27 Tuesdaye.</p>

<p>Susannah Graunt was then three and fourtey yeares
of age seuen weeks &amp; 4 dayes; borne in the yeare
1602 April the 5 Mondaye."</p>

<p>This, as appears, was a second marriage, and Susannah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
was widow of one William Rockwell; and immediately
after the record, follow the names of the
children of her first marriage, five in number. Ruth
Rockwell, the second daughter of Susannah Grant,
married Christopher Huntington, of Norwich, and
their great granddaughter, Martha Huntington, married
Noah Grant, a great grandson of Mathew.</p>

<p>From this marriage came a second Noah Grant, who
was a captain in the old French war, and afterwards
settled in Coventry, Conn. The third son of this
Captain Noah Grant, who also bore the name of Noah,
resided in Coventry, and had a son named for the
Hon. Jesse Root, Chief Justice of the Superior Court
of Connecticut from 1796 to 1807, and this Jesse Root
Grant is the father of Ulysses S. Grant, the man whom
this war anointed to be our leader and captain.</p>

<p>The Mathew and Susanna Grant whose marriage
record is here given, came first to America in the
Mary and John, in the company which settled Dorchester,
Mass., in 1630. They sailed from Plymouth,
in Devonshire, March 20th, and arrived at Nantasket,
May 30th.</p>

<p>The style and spirit of these colonists may be inferred
from the following words of Roger Clap, who
was one of the passengers:</p>

<p>"These godly people resolved to live together;
and therefore they made choice of these two reverend
servants of God, Mr. John Wareham, and Mr. John
Maverick, to be their ministers; so they kept a solemn
day of fasting in the New Hospital in Plymouth, England,
spending it in preaching and praying; where
that worthy man of God, Mr. John White, of Dorchester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
in Dorset, was present and preached unto us the
Word of God, in the fore part of the day, and in the
latter part of the day. As the people did solemnly
make choice of and call those godly ministers to their
office, so also the Rev. Mr. Wareham and Mr. Maverick
did accept thereof, and expressed the same. So
we came by the good hand of the Lord through the
deeps comfortably."</p>

<p>Thus Mathew Grant and his brethren, even before
leaving the old country, were gathered into church
estate for the new, and the planters of Dorchester came
thither as a Puritan church, duly organized, with their
chosen and ordained pastor and teacher. In 1635&ndash;6,
Mr. Wareham and a great part of his flock removed to
Connecticut, and settled a new Dorchester, afterwards
named Windsor. Mathew Grant was one of these
earlier settlers, and was from the first a prominent man
in the church and town. For many years he was the
principal surveyor of lands in Windsor, town clerk
and deacon, and the church records speak highly of
his blameless life. He died in 1681, at the age of
eighty.</p>

<p>Thus from the little body of men who assembled
with fasting and prayer in Plymouth, to form themselves
into a New England colony, descended in the
course of time, a leader and commander that was to
stay up the hands of our great nation in the time of
its severest trial.</p>

<p>The genealogist who has traced the pedigree of
Grant back to England, remarks, that in the veins of
his family was, by successive marriages, intermingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the blood of many of the best old New England families.</p>

<p>Gen. Grant is a genuine son of New England, therefore
to be looked on as a vigorous offshoot of the old
Puritan stock. His father removed from Coventry,
first to Pennsylvania, afterwards to Ohio, and finally
to Illinois, where the Ulysses of these many wanderings
received his classic name. He appears to be a
man of no ordinary class for shrewdness and good
sense. Gen. Grant's mother is one of those sedate,
sensible, serious women, whose households are fit
nurseries for heroes. Industry, economy, patience,
temperance and religion, were the lessons of his early
days. The writer of the "Tanner Boy" has embodied,
probably on good authority, some anecdotes of the
childhood of the boy, which show that there was in
him good stuff to make a man of. One of these is
worth telling:</p>

<p>"I want you to drive the team to such a spot in the
woods," said the father, "where you will find the men
ready to load it with logs, and you will then drive it
home."</p>

<p>The boy drove to the spot, found the logs, but no
men.</p>

<p>Instead of sitting down to crack nuts and wait, as
most boys would, Ulysses said to himself, "I was sent
to bring these logs, and bring them I must, men or no
men," and so by some ingenious mechanical arrangements,
he succeeded in getting them on to the cart
alone, and drove home with them quietly, as if it were
a matter of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
"Why, my son," exclaimed his father, "where are
the men?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, and I don't care," said the boy. "I
got the load without them."</p>

<p>This boy was surely father to the man who took
Vicksburg.</p>

<p>There are other anecdotes given of his fighting a
schoolboy who traduced Washington; of his steady
perseverance in his school studies; and of a school
saying of his, that <i>can't</i> was never a word in his dictionary.
His industry and energy caused his appointment
to West Point, where the young tanner boy took
rank with the scions of the so-styled Southern aristocracy.
It is recorded in his new position that certain
sneers on his industrial calling were promptly resisted,
and that he insisted upon the proper deference to
himself and his order, as a boy of the working classes,
and maintained it by a stalwart good right arm,
which nobody cared to bring down in anger.</p>

<p>Grant graduated with respectable credit from West
Point, in 1843. He is said to have been the best
rider in his class, but not remarkable otherwise. In
the same class were Gen. W.&nbsp;B. Franklin, Gen. I.&nbsp;T.
Quimby, Gen. J.&nbsp;J. Reynolds, Gen. C.&nbsp;C. Augur, Gen.
C.&nbsp;S. Hamilton, Gen. F. Steele, Gen. R. Ingalls, and
Gen. H.&nbsp;M. Judah, all useful and a number of them
eminent officers in the Union Army during the Rebellion.
There were also in the same class several members
who adhered to the rebel cause; R.&nbsp;S. Ripley, S.&nbsp;G.
French, F. Gardner, who surrendered Port Hudson
to Gen. Banks, E.&nbsp;B. Holloway, and one or two others.
At his graduation, no second lieutenancy was vacant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
in the United States Army, and Grant therefore received
a brevet commission as second lieutenant in the
Fourth United States Infantry. With his regiment or
detachments of it, he now served for a time on the
western frontier, near St. Louis, up the Red River,
and elsewhere. When in 1845, Gen. Taylor was ordered
into Texas, the Fourth Regiment and Grant
with it formed part of his force, and they continued
in active service throughout the Mexican War. In
this war, Lieutenant Grant showed great readiness,
sense, and courage. He was in every one of its important
battles except Buena Vista; to us the words
of one of his eulogists, "in all the battles in which
any one man could be." He was repeatedly mentioned
in the reports of his commanding officers for
meritorious conduct. He was appointed first Lieutenant
on the field of battle, at Molino del Rey, for gallantry;
and was breveted Captain for meritorious conduct
in the battle of Chapultepec.</p>

<p>In 1848, after the end of the war, Capt. Grant married
a Miss Dent, from near St. Louis, and for some
years lived in the monotonous routine of the peace establishment;
at Detroit, at Sackett's Harbor, and in
Oregon. To this period of his life belongs a story
that being a good chess player, and very fond of the
game, he found while at Sackett's Harbor an opponent
of superior force. With this champion our stubborn
infantry captain used to play, and as regularly to get
beaten. But he played on, and was accustomed to insist
upon protracting the sitting until his opponent
had actually become so tired that his mind would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
work; when Grant would comfortably balance the
account.</p>

<p>His full commission as captain reached him in August,
1853, but in 1854, having made up his mind that
there was to be a long peace, he resigned his captaincy
and set about establishing himself in civil life. His
first attempt was, to manage a small farm to the southwest
of St. Louis, where he used to cut wood and haul
it to Carondelet, delivering it himself. He diversified
his year during summer, with acting as a collector of
debts in that region. But there is nothing to show
that he enjoyed either wood cutting or dunning, and
he certainly did not grow rich at them. In 1859, he
tried in vain to get the appointment of county engineer;
and he then went into the leather trade, in partnership
with his father, at Galena. The firm quickly
attained high standing for intelligence and integrity,
and the business, at the breaking out of the war, was
prosperous.</p>

<p>It is narrated that Grant's determination to enter
the service against the rebellion was taken and stated
along with the drawing on of his coat, instantly upon
reading the telegram which announced the surrender
of Sumter. He came into the store in the morning,
read the dispatch, and as he took up his coat, which
he had laid off, and put it on again, he observed in
his quiet way, "The government educated me for the
army, and although I have served through one war, I
am still a little in debt to the government, and willing
to discharge the obligation."</p>

<p>Grant, bringing with him a company of volunteers
that he had enlisted, in a few days appeared in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
council-chamber of governor Yates, of Illinois, and tendered
his services to the country as volunteer. The
governor immediately proposed to place him on his
own staff, as mustering officer of volunteers. Grant
expressed a wish for more active service, but was overruled
for the time by the wishes of the governor,
who represented that his military education and experience
would be of great advantage in forming the
raw material now to be made into an army.</p>

<p>In this comparatively humble sphere Grant began
his second military career. He did with all his might
whatever he did, and his exertions in obtaining volunteers
were such that the quota of Illinois was more
than full at the appointed time, and at once set in the
field. In June, 1861, he entered actual service, with
the rank of colonel of volunteers; and took hold of
work with such purpose and efficiency that he was
almost immediately elevated to be Brigadier General.</p>

<p>The patriotic and energetic Governor Yates, gives
the following account of the first months of Grant's
services during the Rebellion.</p>

<p>"In April, 1861, he tendered his personal services
to me, saying, that he 'had been the recipient of a
military education at West Point, and that now, when
the country was involved in a war for its preservation
and safety, he thought it his duty to offer his services
in defense of the Union, and that he would esteem it
a privilege to be assigned to any position where he
could be useful.' The plain, straightforward demeanor
of the man, and the modesty and earnestness which
characterized his offer of assistance, at once awakened
a lively interest in him, and impressed me with a desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
to secure his counsel for the benefit of volunteer
organization then forming for Government service. At
first I assigned him a desk in the Executive office;
and his familiarity with military organization and regulations
made him an invaluable assistant in my own
and the office of the Adjutant-General. Soon his admirable
qualities as a military commander became apparent,
and I assigned him to command of the camps of
organization at 'Camp Yates,' Springfield, 'Camp
Grant,' Mattoon, and 'Camp Douglas,' at Anna, Union
County. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* "The Twenty-first regiment of
Illinois volunteers, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* had become very much
demoralized under the thirty days' experiment, and
doubts arose in relation to their acceptance for a longer
period. I was much perplexed to find an efficient
and experienced officer to take command of the regiment,
and take it into the three years' service. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
I decided to offer the command to Captain Grant,
at Covington, Kentucky, tendering him the colonelcy.
He immediately reported, accepting the commission,
taking rank as colonel of that regiment from the 15th
of June, 1861. Thirty days previous to that time,
the regiment numbered over one thousand men; but
in consequence of laxity of discipline of the first commanding
officer, and other discouraging obstacles connected
with the acceptance of troops at that time,
but six hundred and three men were found willing to
enter the three years' service. In less than ten days
Colonel Grant filled the regiment to the maximum
standard, and brought it to a state of discipline seldom
attained in the volunteer service in so short a
time. His was the only regiment that left the camp of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
organization on foot. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Colonel Grant was
afterwards assigned to command for the protection
of the Quincy and Palmyra, and Hannibal and St.
Josephs Railroads. He soon distinguished himself as
a regimental commander in the field, and his claims
for increased rank were recognized by his friends in
Springfield, and his promotion insisted upon, before
his merits and services were fairly understood at
Washington."</p>

<p>Grant's brigadier's commission reached him August
9th, 1861, and his first service under it was, a march to
Ironton, in Missouri, for the purpose of preventing an
attack from the rebel Jeff Thompson. Grant had
already once declined a brigadiership when offered
him by Gov. Yates, for the reason that he considered
the appointment more properly due to another person;
but though the youngest of the colonels in Missouri,
he had been acting brigadier there.</p>

<p>Soon after this he was placed in command at the
great central point of Cairo, which was the key of the
West.</p>

<p>The country was full of confusion and disorder.
Rebel sympathizers every where, openly and secretly,
were embarrassing the Federal and assisting the rebel
army. The professedly neutral State of Kentucky
was used as the camping ground and retreat of these
forces which thus annoyed our army. Grant quietly
determined to command this dangerous territory.
He took the town of Paducah, a strong post on the
Ohio River, near the mouth of the Tennessee River,
in Kentucky, by which he at once gained possession of
interior navigable waters, which the traitors had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
using for their own purposes. The strength and decision
with which he took possession of the town intimidated
all rebel sympathizers. He then issued the
following address to the inhabitants, which is as good
a specimen of condensed and effective military style
as we have on record:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am come among you, not as an enemy, but as
your fellow-American; not to maltreat and annoy you,
but to respect and enforce the rights of all loyal citizens.
I am here to defend you against the common
enemy, who has planted his guns on your soil, and
fired upon you; and to assist the authority and sovereignty
of your government. I have nothing to do
with opinions, and shall deal only with armed rebellion
and its aiders and abetters. You can pursue your
usual avocations without fear. The strong arm of the
government is here to protect its friends, and punish
its enemies. Whenever it is manifest that you are
able to defend yourselves, maintain the authority of
the government, and protect the rights of loyal citizens,
I shall withdraw the forces under my command.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l6"><span class="smcap">U. S. Grant</span>,</span><br />
Brig. Gen. Commanding.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="p2">While in command at Cairo, Grant used to dress
rather carelessly, very much after Gen. Taylor's fashion;
he went about wearing an old "stove-pipe hat,"
and always with a cigar. Some one, it is said, once
jeered about the "stove-pipe general" and his cigars,
and was silenced by the reply that "such a bright
stove-pipe might be excused for smoking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
The remainder of General Grant's military career
must be narrated with a brevity which by no means
does justice to the subject. It may be said to consist
of five campaigns; those of Fort Donelson, Corinth
and Iuka, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, and Richmond.
Of these, each pointed out its commander as
the best man for the next, until by simple upward
gravitation of natural fitness, he rose to his present
great military post of general of all the armies of the
United States.</p>

<p>Grant's operations in Northern Missouri, his dash
on Belmont, and his seizure of Paducah, though all
creditable military services, were thrown into the
shade by the brilliant Fort Donelson campaign, which
opened the career of Union successes in the West.</p>

<p>The Fort Donelson expedition was intended to
break in two the rebel defensive line, which stretched
the whole length of the State of Kentucky, from Columbus
on the Mississippi, through Bowling Green, to
Cumberland Gap. On this line, the rebels, under
General A.&nbsp;S. Johnston, stood looking northward with
threatening and defiant aspect. Grant saw that if he
could seize Forts Henry and Donelson, which had been
built to shut up the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers,
the Union gunboats could range up and down through
the heart of rebeldom, and the Union armies with
them, and that thus the great rebel defensive line, cut
through in the middle, would be broken as a chain is
when a link is destroyed. He therefore asked leave
of his immediate superior, Halleck, to take the forts;
received it, concerted his plan of attack with Admiral
Foote, and moved from Cairo, February 2d, 1862.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
The success of this expedition is well known. It
should be recorded, however, even in this short summary,
that to Grant is due the credit of possessing the
military tact and promptness that showed him when
to make the decisive attack, and impelled him to do
it. This time was after that considerable success of
the rebel sally from Fort Donelson on Saturday, Feb.
15th, under Pillow, which drove away so large a portion
of the Union army from its place, and indeed left
room enough for the whole rebel force to walk out of
the fort and escape, if they had so chosen. This was
done while Grant had gone to consult with Admiral
Foote. When he came back, and saw how his troops
had been driven, to any common mind the case would
have seemed a pretty bad one; but Grant really does
not appear to have seen any bad side to any case he
had charge of during the war. At Belmont, when he
was told that he was surrounded, he simply answered,
"Well, then, we must cut our way out." His own description,
afterwards given to Gen. Sherman, at Shiloh,
of the impression now made on his mind by seeing how
his troops had been pounded and driven, was as follows:
"On riding upon the field, I saw that either side
was ready to give way if the other showed a bold
front. I took the opportunity, and ordered an advance
along the whole line." In both cases, the thing was
done.</p>

<p>At daylight on Sunday, the 16th, Gen. Buckner,
(whose two superior officers, Floyd and Pillow, had
run away,) sent a flag of truce asking for commissioners
to consider terms of capitulation. Grant replied
by the bearer, in a letter, two of whose phrases have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
become permanent contributions to the proverbial part
of the English language:</p>

<p>"Yours of this date, proposing an armistice, and
appointment of commissioners to settle terms of capitulation,
is just received. No terms other than unconditional
and immediate surrender can be accepted. I
propose to move immediately upon your works."</p>

<p>Buckner's reply was in a very disgusted tone, and
it may be excused to him under the circumstances,
that he used some very curious explanatory phrases,
and that he called names. But he came down, though
it was from an extremely high horse, rejoining:</p>

<p>"The distribution of the forces under my command,
incident to an unexpected change of commanders, and
the overwhelming force under your command, compel
me, notwithstanding the brilliant success of the confederate
arms yesterday, to accept the ungenerous and
unchivalrous terms which you propose."</p>

<p>The correctness of Grant's estimate of this whole
movement was well proved by its instantaneous result&mdash;the
evacuation of Columbus at one end of the rebel
line, and of Bowling Green in the middle, and the
falling back of the whole rebellion down to the southern
boundary of Tennessee. The first great victory
since Bull Run, the first important campaign in the
West, it encouraged and elevated the spirits of the
whole North, and in equal measure it alarmed and enfeebled
the South. It had flung back the rebellion
two hundred miles, along the whole length of Kentucky,
across that State and Tennessee. With soldierly
promptitude and energy, Grant followed up his victory
by pushing the enemy, according to the Napoleonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
maxim, that "victory is, to march ten leagues,
beat the enemy, and pursue him ten leagues more."</p>

<p>Immediately after Donelson, Grant was made major
general of volunteers by commission dated on the day
of the fall of the fort, and was placed in command of
the "Military District of West Tennessee," consisting
of a long triangle with its northern point at Cairo, its
base at the south, on the Mississippi State line, and its
sides the Tennessee and Mississippi rivers. Thus promoted,
Grant had already pushed southward. Foote's
gunboats ascended the Cumberland, the troops kept
abreast of them; Clarksville, with twenty days' subsistence
for Grant's whole army, was occupied on Feb.
20th, four days after the capture of Donelson; and
on the 23d, the advance of Buell's army, operating in
conjunction with Grant's, entered Nashville.</p>

<p>When the rebel military line already mentioned,
running lengthwise of the State of Kentucky, was
broken up by Grant's getting through and behind it
at Fort Donelson, the rebel leaders sought to hold
another east and west line, coinciding nearly with the
southern line of Tennessee, along the important Memphis
and Charleston Railroad, and their commander in
the West, Albert Sydney Johnston, set about concentrating
his forces at Corinth, on that road. Halleck,
by this time commanding the whole Department of
the Mississippi, now prepared to attack Corinth. It
was with this design that Grant's army was sent up
the Tennessee, and encamped at Shiloh. But the
rebels did not wait to be attacked. They advanced
themselves, with the bold and judicious design of
beating the army at Shiloh, and then of marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
northward, regaining all the ground they had lost,
and retaliating by an invasion of the States north of
the Ohio.</p>

<p>This hardy attempt was well nigh successful. The
night before the battle of Shiloh, Beauregard, as the
rebel council of war separated, had prophesied: "To-morrow
night we sleep in the enemy's camp." The
sudden and vehement assault of the morning, maintained
with tremendous and pertinacious fury all day
long, had steadily crushed the Union army backward
towards the Tennessee river, until towards sunset it
had been pounded into a heterogeneous, irregular line
of desperate fighters, and behind them a great mass
of terrified and disheartened runaways, hiding under
the river bank. What the heathen called Fortune,
what Christians recognize as an overruling Providence,
caused a conjuncture of circumstances by which, between
night and morning, the relative number and
spirits of the troops on both sides, and the result of
the fight, were totally reversed. These circumstances
were, the powerful resistance offered, at the end of
the Sunday's disastrous fight, to the final charges of
the rebels, by the artillery massed at the left end or
key of the Union position, close to the river; by the
further obstacle of a ravine stretching back from the
river before the Union lines just at that point; by
the powerful effect of the monstrous shells sent up
this ravine and into the rebel lines from the two Union
gunboats, Tyler and Lexington; and finally, by the
coming upon the field of the advance of Buell's army.
Beauregard's men slept in the Union camp, as he had
said, but during the night Buell's troops and Gen. Lewis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Wallace's division came upon the field. Monday morning,
instead of last night's picture of 30,000 rebels,
flushed with all day's victory, against at most 23,000
disorganized and all but overpowered Union troops,
the daylight broke on a Union army of 50,000, being
Grant's 23,000, somewhat refreshed and reorganized,
and entirely inspirited; and 27,000 reinforcements,
fresh and unbroken; while the rebel army, exhausted
by its own efforts, had received no increase, had lost
by stragglers, had rested ill in the cold rain, and had
been all night long awakened every few minutes by
the unwelcome reveillee of the great gunboat shells that
were flung amongst them from the river. Weary and
overweighted as they were, the rebels fought well,
however, and it was not until four in the afternoon
that they retreated, fighting still, and in good order,
toward Corinth, whence they had set out.</p>

<p>When the rebels first attacked, Grant was at Savannah,
seven miles down the river. Hastening back, he
was on the field at the earliest possible moment, and
did whatever could be done to withstand the tremendous
force of the rebel advance. When Buell came
upon the field toward night, the aspect of affairs so
struck him that his first inquiry of Grant was, what
preparations he had made for retreat.</p>

<p>"I have not despaired of whipping them yet," was
the thoroughly characteristic reply. One account adds,
that when Buell urged that a prudent general ought
to provide for possibilities of defeat, and repeated his
inquiry, Grant pointed to his transports and said,
"Don't you see those boats?" "Yes," said Buell, "but
they will not carry more than ten thousand, and we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
more than thirty thousand." "Well," returned Grant,
"ten thousand are more than I mean to retreat with."</p>

<p>One prominent, elaborate and ambitious account of
this battle, by a writer who has been complimented
as "the Napier of the War," is visibly framed with the
intention of omitting Grant entirely from this battle;
since no part of the narrative suggests that he gave a
single order, or shows that he was on the field. But
this slander by omission is utterly gratuitous. General
Sherman's report tells how Grant "was early on the
field, and visited his (Sherman's) division in person
about ten A.&nbsp;M., when the battle was raging fiercely;"
and again, how Grant, who had been on the field and
frequently under fire, all day long, returned to him at
5 P.&nbsp;M., and explained the situation of the rest of the
field. Sherman adds, "he agreed that the enemy had
expended the <i>force</i> of his attack, and we estimated
our loss and approximated our then strength. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
He then ordered me to get all things ready, and
at daylight the next day to assume the offensive. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
I know I had orders from General Grant to assume
the offensive before I knew General Buell was
on the west side of the Tennessee." It was doubtless
at this time that Grant made to Sherman the remark
already quoted, as to the readiness of either side, at
Donelson, to retreat.</p>

<p>Another witness, who, unlike our deceitful "Napier
of the Rebellion," was on the field of Shiloh, describes
how "throughout the battle, Grant rode to and fro
on the front, smoking his inevitable cigar, with his usual
stolidity and good fortune; horses and men were killed
all around him, but he did not receive a scratch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
The consequence of Shiloh was, the withdrawal of
the rebels from their second line of defence, by their
evacuation of Corinth on the 30th of May, seven
weeks afterwards, the disappointment both of their
great plan of a northern invasion and of their secondary
plan of holding the Memphis and Charleston
Railroad line, and the opening of all Tennessee, and
the North of Mississippi and Alabama, to the Union
forces; the opening of the Mississippi River from
Memphis down to Vicksburg; the subsequent movement
which resulted in the battle of Murfreesboro
and the securing of Chattanooga on the east; and
the series of efforts which culminated in the capture
of Vicksburg on the west. In short, this battle flung
the Rebellion, in the Valley of the Mississippi, into a
defensive posture, out of which it never escaped during
the remainder of the war.</p>

<p>A few days after the proclamation which gave freedom
to the slaves, General Grant expressed his concurrence
in it after his sober fashion, by a dry phrase
in a general order on the subject of organizing colored
regiments. "It is expected," he says, "that all commanders
will especially exert themselves in carrying
out the policy of the administration, not only in organizing
colored regiments, and rendering them effective,
but also in removing prejudice against them."</p>

<p>The taking of Fort Donelson had given Grant a
reputation as a prompt and vigorous fighter, and a
sensible commander. The battle of Shiloh, when its
extremely important results came to be understood,
added to his reputation in a proportionate degree.
While therefore one line of operations was decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
upon, which pointed eastward and was to end in the occupation
of Chattanooga, Rosecrans being placed in
command, to the westward and southward, a second
great enterprise was aimed, which was entrusted to
Grant; which should end in the occupation of Vicksburg,
and should thus complete the task which the
men of the northwest had proposed to themselves at
the beginning of the war, of "hewing their way to
the sea."</p>

<p>Vicksburg and Port Hudson were now the only remaining
two of that series of positions, most of them
really impregnable from the river, by which the rebels
had throttled the great artery of western commerce.</p>

<p>His previous career naturally enough pointed out
Grant for the command of the Vicksburg campaign;
and the event showed that his absolute inability to let
go where he had once taken hold, his inevitable continuance
in hammering at his object, were exactly the
qualities needed.</p>

<p>For a little while, General Halleck himself came and
commanded in person against Corinth, General Grant
being second in command. It was during this period
that both the two occasions occurred, which are said
to have been the only ones when Grant was ever known
to lose his temper. His steady nature and calm good
humor had become proverbial among his fellows even
while he was a student; for about the time of his leaving
West Point, the cadets said of him, to use his
father's words, that the only difficulty about him was,
that "if he ever was engaged in war, he was too good
natured to be kicked into a fight." The two occasions
spoken of are said to have been; one, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
discovered a soldier defiling the water of a clear
spring; and the other, when he wished to "move at
once upon the works" of Beauregard at Corinth, ten
days before General Halleck was ready; as he saw
that by so doing the whole rebel army in the place
could be taken. Of his urgency with Halleck, his
father Mr. Jesse R. Grant, says, "He (Grant) is sure
he used stronger language to General Halleck than
he had ever used before to any person, and expected
to be arrested and tried. But the General said to him,
'If I had let you take your own course, you would
have taken the rebel army. Hereafter I will not dictate
to you about the management of an army!'"</p>

<p>Halleck now left, being appointed General-in-Chief;
and Grant remained in command of the Army of the
Tennessee, and of the military districts of Cairo, West
Tennessee and Mississippi. The rebels knew as well
as he that his face was set steadfastly towards Vicksburg;
and to begin with, they attacked his troops at
Corinth and Iuka in great force and with tremendous
fury, in order to break up his plans. At both places
they were however defeated. In October, the rebel
General Pemberton was placed in command in Northern
Mississippi, and in the last two months of 1862,
took place Grant's first attempt against Vicksburg.
The place had already been attacked by the two powerful
fleets of Farragut and Davis, during seventy
days, from the preceding May 18th to July 27th; but
though 25,000 shot and shell had been thrown into
it, not one gun had been dismounted, and only seven
men were killed and fifteen wounded; a result which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
showed plainly enough how the place was to be taken
if at all.</p>

<p>Grant's movement was to be by land, southward
from his post at Corinth, directly at Pemberton;
while Sherman was to get footing if possible close to
Vicksburg. The loss of Grant's main depot of supplies
at Holly Springs, midway in his progress, broke
down his part of the plan, and Pemberton then reinforcing
Vicksburg, repulsed Sherman and broke down
the rest of it.</p>

<p>Grant now established his head-quarters at Memphis,
January 10th, 1863, and moved his army towards his
goal by water. On the 2d of February, he reached
Young's Point, a little above the city; his army was
already there and at Milliken's Bend, just below.</p>

<p>His purpose was one; to get his army across to the
Vicksburg side and thence to prosecute his attack.
First he tried a canal across the neck of the river
peninsula opposite Vicksburg. Through this, if he
could get the water to accept it as a new bed, he could
take his forces below the city, out of reach of its guns,
and cross over. But a flood burst into the unfinished
canal and drowned out the plan. Then he tried to
clear out a longer water route to do the same thing,
through a string of bayous and rivers back in the Louisiana
swamps. A fall in the river broke up this plan,
as a rise had done that before it. Then he tried a
longer route of the same sort, beginning at Lake
Providence, seventy-five miles north of Vicksburg, but
it was found impracticable. Then resorting to the east
side of the Mississippi, he sent a naval expedition to
try to penetrate Yazoo Pass, and thence through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
inconceivable tangle of the Yazoo swamps and their
rivers, to get behind the outer rebel defences north of
Vicksburg, and so make a lodgment. But this plan
was checkmated by the hasty erection in the heart of
the swamp region, at the junction of the Tallahatchie
and Yazoo Rivers, of a powerful fort, which the fleet
tried in vain to silence. Then he sent another fleet to
try another part of the same monstrous tangle, by way
of the Big Sunflower River, but that effort miscarried
much as the preceding one did.</p>

<p>The obstinate commander had now tried six assaults
upon his prey, and had been busily working at his
failures for nearly four months. March 29th, 1863, he
set his forces in motion for the seventh and successful
effort. This was by what he had in fact recognized
from the beginning as the best line of operation&mdash;by
the south. It was however also the most difficult.
As one of the historians of the war observes, a measure
of the difficulties offered is given by the fact that
General W.&nbsp;T. Sherman was not disposed to advise it.
The same writer adds, "It can only be said that there
was that in the composition of General Grant's mind
that prompted him to undertake that which no one
else would have adventured."</p>

<p>Colonel Grierson's cavalry force was now launched
down from Tennessee to go tearing through the whole
interior of Mississippi, and thoroughly frighten all its
people, while he should break up, as he circuited far
around Vicksburg, as many as possible of the railroads,
bridges, and other means of communication, leading
from the city back into the country, or from one part
of the State to another. Grant's own troops moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
down the river a total distance of seventy-five miles.
The fleet and transports ran the batteries and ferried
the army across at Bruinsburg; Grant moved at once
three miles inland, and May 1st, beat Gen. Bowen at
Port Gibson. Then he moved eastward, drove Johnston
out of Jackson, an important center for railroad
lines, and broke up all the communications in the
neighborhood; then turning short about, he approached
Vicksburg by forced marches; on May 10th met
Pemberton at Champion Hills and defeated him; followed
him sharply up, forced the passage of the Big
Black, drove Pemberton into the city, and on May
16th had formed his lines of attack. After a vigorous
siege, whose progress attracted the attention of the
whole civilized world, the place surrendered with
27,000 men, on July 4th, 1863. The whole number
of prisoners made since crossing the Mississippi was
37,000. This great achievement freed the Mississippi,
cut the rebellion in two, and rendered it out of the
question for the rebels to hold the Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p>The taking of Vicksburg was remarkable, not so
much as a successful engineering attack against earthworks,
as it was when considered as the culmination
of a well planned campaign. The place was in fact
taken a good ways away from it. Grierson's wide destruction
of the railroads and bridges, and the far
wider fright which he spread among the rebels, were
part of the fatal preliminaries which were the most
decisive parts of the attack. Such were also the series
of battles which so relentlessly pounded Pemberton
backwards into the trap where he was finally
caged; particularly the expulsion of the rebel forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
from Jackson, just before the siege. All these operations
gradually fixed Pemberton where he could not
get out, and where his friends could not help him out;
and so he waited until he had no more provisions, and
then gave up. There seems no reason for believing
that the assault which Grant had arranged to give on
the 6th, if the surrender had not been made on the
4th, would have been more successful than either of
the previous assaults; the earthworks of Vicksburg
were skillfully and strongly built, and were much the
stronger because they stood on ground itself naturally
very strong. The great feature of the transaction was
therefore the broad and far-seeing wisdom of a general
who can organize campaigns, rather than the mere
ability of a colonel to make a furious assault at the
head of his regiment. That this was the nature of
the campaign, appears from the history of the preliminary
part of it; and so it does, from Grant's
own dispatch to Sherman, on hearing that Johnston
was doing his best to get together an army to relieve
the place. "They seem," wrote Grant, "to put a
great deal of faith in the Lord and Joe Johnston,
but <i>you</i> must whip Johnston at least fifteen miles from
here." That battle never happened.</p>

<p>It is said that during the dreary days of the siege
of Vicksburg, a knot of men collected in a druggist's
shop in Cincinnati, were discussing the probabilities
of his success in taking Vicksburg. An aged countryman,
who had been a silent listener, was at last appealed
to for his opinion.</p>

<p>"I rather think he'll do it," said the stranger, in a
tone of certainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
"What makes you think so?" said the company.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; but our Ulysses always did
do whatever he said he would. You see Ulysses is
my boy," added the old man; and the event justified
his confidence.</p>

<p>Never was an enterprise hedged in with difficulties
more gigantic; but against these Grant placed the
silent, inflexible force of a will which no length of
time could weary, no obstacles discourage, and the
combinations of a brain which seemed equally capable
of attending to the vastest plans and the most trivial
minutiæ.</p>

<p>We can all remember that thrill of joy and thankfulness
which vibrated through the country when the
telegraph flashed through it the news of this victory.
It was a double triumph for the nation. Not only
was Vicksburg taken, but the General and commander
that the nation had long been looking for was at last
made manifest.</p>

<p>In vain did envy and jealousy at this point intrigue
against him, and endeavor to fill the ear of the President
with suspicions. "I assure you he is a hard
drinker," said one of these detractors. The "slow,
wise smile" that we so well remember, rose over that
rugged face as Lincoln made answer:</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me exactly <i>what</i> he drinks.
I should like to send some of the same brand to all
my other Generals."</p>

<p>No; there was no deceiving Lincoln. He knew a
man when he saw him, and was ready to put all power
in hands that he saw were strong enough to use it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
General Grant's commission as major-general in the
regular army was dated July 4, 1863, the day of the
occupation of Vicksburg. In the succeeding October
he was placed in command of the great "Military Division
of the Mississippi," consisting of the three "Departments"
of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the
Tennessee, and including the command of four strong
armies; his own, Hooker's, and those of the Cumberland
and the Ohio.</p>

<p>Grant's next victory was that of Chattanooga, Nov.
25, 1863, which substantially repaired the ill effects of
the defeat of Rosecrans at Chickamauga, and assured the
possession of the mountain citadel from which in the
next spring Sherman sallied on his way to Atlanta.</p>

<p>A very thorough effort to extract a speech from
Grant was made at St. Louis, January 29, 1864, after
the victory of Chattanooga. There was a public dinner
in his honor. When the regular toast to "our
distinguished guest" was offered and drank, and the
band had capped the compliment with "Hail to the
Chief," the guest would, on political principles have
talked for at least half an hour. Grant got up and
said: "Gentlemen&mdash;in response it will be impossible
for me to do more than to thank you." In the evening
there was a serenade, and a great crowd to hear
it. When Grant came out on the balcony, everybody
shouted "Speech, speech!" and then was the time for
another able political manifesto, say of an hour long.
The General took off his hat. Everybody was perfectly
still. At last a speech from the Silent General!
But that commander had now "found a can't in his
dictionary." "Gentlemen," he said, "I thank you for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
this honor. I cannot make a speech. It is something
I have never done, and never intend to do, and I beg
you will excuse me." So he put on his hat, took out
a cigar, lit it, smoked, and looked at the rockets. The
crowd kept bawling out, "Speech, speech, speech!"
A foolish local politician who had been let into the
balcony, offered the General a piece of worn-out clap-trap
to fling to the crowd. "Tell them," said he,
"that you can fight for them, but can't talk to them."
The General quietly intimated that he should leave
such things for others to say. Still they bawled
"Speech!" and once more the "very obstinate man,"
taking his cigar from his lips, leaned over the railing
and puffed forth the smoke as if to speak. "Now,
then," said the excited crowd, and they were all still.
"Gentlemen," said Grant, "making speeches is not
my business. I never did it in my life, and I never
will. I thank you, however, for your attendance
here."</p>

<p>On March 10th, 1864, Grant was appointed Lieutenant
General, and placed in command of all the armies
of the United States. The first law passed at
that winter's session had been a joint resolution thanking
Grant and the officers and men that had fought
under him, and providing for an honorary medal to
be presented to him by the United States, in testimony
thereof.</p>

<p>The Union armies, as Grant himself had already
remarked, in his dry way, had hitherto "acted independently,
and without concert, like a baulky team,
no two pulling together."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Henceforward, in his single strong hand, those armies
worked together. The rebel leaders could no
longer beat a Union army at one end of the line of
hostilities by massing all their troops upon it, and then
whirl them away to the other end and beat another.
As Grant was engaged in crossing the Rapidan at the
opening of the final Richmond campaign, he sat down
on a log by the roadside and wrote a few words which
were telegraphed from Washington. They let Sherman
loose to co-operate in the South with the Army
of the Potomac in the north&mdash;and the Rebellion was
ground to dust between the two.</p>

<p>In this final movement, the first act was the battle
of the Wilderness. There is a story that upon the
next morning after the first day's struggling in those
tangled and all but impassable woods, Lee and his officers
came out as aforetime, to see the Union forces
going back again over the river; and that when he saw,
instead, signs of their resuming the attack, he remarked
to his companions, "They have a general now. It is
all up with us!" The story may not be true; but its
facts were. It was after six days of battle that Grant
sent to Washington the dispatch which ended with the
grim remark, "I propose to fight it out on this line if
it takes all summer." Spottsylvania followed, and
Cold Harbor; the investment of Petersburg, and that
long series of assaults, forays, entrenchments and battles
which ended with the surrender of Lee and the
explosion of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>In the early days of the campaign, Mrs. Grant gave
an opinion about Richmond, which was as well founded
as that of the General's father about Vicksburg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Somebody was so good as to express to her a hope
that her husband would take Richmond. Mrs. Grant
observed, with a dry simplicity of phrase that sounded
as if she had gone to school to her husband as well as
married him; "Well, I don't know. I think he may.
<i>Mr. Grant always was a very obstinate man!</i>"</p>

<p>From the time of Grant's first appointment, he has
gone on steadily, firmly, and without bluster or parade,
doing the impossible, and demonstrating his early saying,
that there was no can't in his dictionary. In
quiet reticence and persevering patience he resembles
the Duke of Wellington more than any of the great
military leaders. Like Wellington and George Washington,
he seems possessed of a buoyancy of capacity
which always and steadily rises to the height of any
emergency.</p>

<p>How modestly and quietly he received promotion;
how earnestly and wisely he set to work, when all the
reins of power were in his hands, to organize that last
splendid campaign that issued in the taking of Richmond
and the surrender of Lee, the people do not
need to be told. It will be had in everlasting remembrance.</p>

<p>Never had man more efficient Generals to second
him. Grant's marshals were not inferior to Napoleon's,
and the unenvying, patriotic ability with which he and
they worked together is not the least noticeable feature
in the campaign whose glory they share with him.</p>

<p>The war closed leaving General Grant, who entered
it an obscure trader, in a position perhaps as
noticeable and brilliant as any in the civilized world.
He stands in the front rank among the leaders of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
society, and in our American affairs, still critical,
he shows a judgment, and a prudence, and a temperate
wisdom which seem to point him out as no less
fit to rule in peace than in war.</p>

<p>General Grant has many qualities which fit him to
be a ruler of men. Among them are some plain and
common-place virtues. Such is his unflinching adherence
to what he thinks is right. Such is his unconditional
public and private honesty. This was well
exemplified in the solicitous care with which he kept
the cotton business outside of his command in the
West, as long as possible, from a well founded dislike
of its immense corrupting power.</p>

<p>When at last he had to consent to allow the progress
of trade into the territory taken from the rebels,
he specified that, at least, it should be kept in the
hands of honest and trusty and undoubted Unionists.
He was then asked to name such men. He replied,
"I will do no such thing. If I did, it would appear
in less than a week that I was a partner of every one
of the persons trading under my authority."</p>

<p>Such another virtue is, that scrupulous official economy
by which General Grant has already saved our
over-taxed country five million dollars a year, by cutting
down expenses in the War Department.</p>

<p>He also possesses other very noticeable qualifications
of a more special sort, and so much rarer among public
men, that they must be named even in the shortest
inventory of General Grant's character. Two of these
are, the broadest and most generous justice in attributing
the credit of doing well where it belongs, and
remarkable wisdom in judging and selecting men. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the former quality, his letter to Sherman at the time
of his appointment as Lieutenant-General is a good instance.
That letter, exceedingly honorable evidence
of simplicity and justice in the writer, and of merit in
the recipient, was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sherman</span>:&mdash;The bill reviving the grade of
Lieutenant-General in the army has become a law, and
my name has been sent to the Senate for the place.
I now receive orders to report to Washington immediately

likelihood of confirmation.</p>

<p>I start in the morning to comply with the order.</p>

<p>Whilst I have been eminently successful in this war,
in at least gaining the confidence of the public, no one
feels more than I how much of this success is due to
the energy and skill, and the harmonious putting forth
of that energy and skill, of those whom it has been my
good fortune to have occupying subordinate positions
under me.</p>

<p>There are many officers to whom these remarks are
applicable to a greater or less degree, proportionate
to their ability as soldiers; but what I want is to express
my thanks to you and McPherson, as the men to
whom, above all others, I feel indebted for whatever
I have had of success.</p>

<p>How far your advice and assistance have been of
help to me you know. How far your execution of
whatever has been given you to do entitles you to the
reward I am receiving, you cannot know as well as I.</p>

<p>I feel all the gratitude this letter would express,
giving it the most flattering construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
The word <i>you</i> I use in the plural, intending it for
McPherson also. I should write to him, and will some
day; but, starting in the morning, I do not know that
I will find time just now.</p>

<p class="p2">Of his wisdom in selecting and trusting assistants
and subordinates, the list of their names is a very sufficient
evidence. The proved possession of this one
faculty goes very far to prove that its possessor is competent
to govern; and when a strong will and stainless
public and private morals are added, the presumption
grows very much stronger.</p>

<p>A gigantic power of minding his own business and
holding his tongue is even a greater wonder in General
Grant than his being honest and just. An instance
of his successful resistance to the most violent pumping
of him for a speech, has been given; and other
such brilliant "flashes of silence," as Sydney Smith
would have called them, illuminate his whole career
during and since the war. He has been recently subjected
to a very similar and more vexatious series of
similar endeavors by the politicians who have been
buzzing about him as he has become more and more
plainly needed as next President. These noxious
creatures have tried every conceivable trick to make
him say something to show him a member of their
party&mdash;for mere patriotism and uprightness will not
serve these bigoted sectarians.</p>

<p>Thus far the silent soldier has defied them all. In
January, 1864, somebody said something to him about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the Presidency. He put the subject by, saying, "Let
us first settle the war, and it will be time enough then
to talk upon that subject." A little while afterwards
some one referred to a certain resolute effort to make
him talked of as a candidate, and he then laid down
his famous Side-walk Platform: "When this war is
over," said he, "I intend to run for mayor of Galena,
and if elected I intend to have the sidewalk fixed up
between my house and the depot." Properly understood,
this is a very quiet but very sarcastic valuation
of office-seeking.</p>

<p>Not long ago, Senator Wade complained to a newspaper
reporter who immediately printed the story,
that he "had often tried to find out whether Grant
was for Congress or Johnson, or what the devil he was
for, but never could get anything out of him, for as
quick as he'd talk politics Grant would talk horse, and
he could talk horse by the hour." This was a horrible
irritation to the old politician, who could not be content
to judge the man by his acts. This was a great
error. One would imagine that of all men a veteran
politician would have been first to recognize the utter
emptiness of words and professions. If Gen. Grant's
views are not consistent with the unbroken record of
his whole life of action, he is the most gigantic hypocrite
the world ever saw, and in that event it is certainly
useless to try to make him expose himself now.
If his views are in harmony with his acts, it is assuredly
useless to state them, and as a respectable citizen
and a man of dignified self-respect, he may justly be
offended at such superfluous attempts to coax him to
make affidavits to his own character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
A Texas political editor, in November, 1867, while
Gen. Grant was acting Secretary of War, pushed his
way into the General's private office, and "had an interview"
with him. He went right to work with his
feelers, as is the method of this species of insect, and
told Grant that "the people of his section wanted the
General for President." Grant turned the subject.
The editor, being one of that sort of "gentlemen"
who see no connection between politics and politeness,
turned the subject promptly back again, saying,
"General, we want to run you for President, and I want
to know what I can say when I return home." Grant
answered with peremptory decision, "Say nothing, sir;
I want nothing said."</p>

<p>No other but a man of his peculiar character and
power could have borne the ordeal of forming a part
of the President's suite in his late unpopular progress
through the Northern States. The discretion, delicacy
and wisdom with which he sustained himself, show a
character capable of the most skillful adaptations.
We are indebted to his wise presence and temperate
advice in averting the threatened danger of civil war
in Maryland: for, like all wise and great Generals,
Grant is duly impressed with the horrors of war, and
will be always for every possible means of averting
such an evil.</p>

<p>In all these respects Grant has shown a wise statesmanship,
which points him out to the country as the
fittest one to replace to it what was lost in the sudden
death of Lincoln. Should an appeal be made to the
people, we think there is no name that would meet a
more overwhelming and enthusiastic response.</p>

<p>We have written the name of a man who has had
a more marked influence on our late national history
than any other person who could be mentioned. No
man has been more positively active in bringing on
that great moral and political agitation whose issues
have been in those recent scenes and events which
no American can ever forget.</p>

<p>When we remember that it was begun by one man,
singlehanded, alone, unfriended, despised and poor, we
must feel in advance that such a man came of no common
stock, and possessed no common elements of character.
We are interested to inquire after the parentage
and the early forming causes which have produced
such results. In Mr. Garrison's case he frankly ascribes
all that he is, or has ever been or done, to the
training, example and influence of a mother whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>early history and life-long character were of uncommon
interest.</p>

<p>She was born of English stock, in the province of
New Brunswick, and grew up in that lethargic state of
society which has received not an impulse or a new
idea since the time of Queen Anne. Her parents attended
the Established Church, drank the king's health
on all proper occasions, and observed the gradual
growing up of a beautiful and spirited daughter with
tranquil satisfaction.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen this young girl, with a party
of gay companions, went from curiosity to attend the
religious services of some itinerating Baptists, who
were startling the dead echoes of that region by a
style of preaching, praying and exhorting, such as
never had been heard there before. They were commonly
called Ranters, and the young people promised
themselves no small amusement from the spectacle of
their extravagances.</p>

<p>But the beautiful and gay girl carried unknown and
dormant in her own nature, the elements of an earnest
and lofty religious character, which no touch of the
droning services of a dead church had ever yet stirred
to consciousness&mdash;and the wild singing, the fervent exhortations,
the vivid and real emotions which were exhibited
in this meeting, fired the electric train and
roused the fervor of her own nature. Life, death,
eternity, all became vivid and real to her, and the
command to come out from a vain world and be separate;
to confess Christ openly before men, seemed to
her to have a living and present power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
It is very commonly the case that minds for the first
time awakened to the real power of religion, feel that
the only true faith is to be found under the forms and
ideas which have so moved them, and that to confess
Christ means a visible union with any particular body
of Christians who have made real to them the Christian
idea. Such was the call felt by this young girl to join
herself with this despised body of Christians.</p>

<p>Her parents were greatly shocked and annoyed
when they found that instead of ridiculing the Ranters,
she was going again and again to their services, with
an undissembled earnestness: and when finally she
announced to them her purpose to unite herself to
them in the public ordinance of baptism, their indignation
knew no bounds, and they threatened her that
if she did she should never enter their doors again, or
be to them more than a stranger.</p>

<p>Then was the crisis in which the woman stood between
two worlds&mdash;two kinds of life&mdash;on one side, the
most earnest and whole-hearted excitement of the
higher moral feelings, on the other side, the material
good things of this world.</p>

<p>The mother of Lloyd Garrison hesitated not a moment
between the convictions of her conscience and a
worldly good. Like the primitive Christians, she
went down into the waters of baptism feeling that she
was leaving father, mother, and home, and casting
herself on God alone.</p>

<p>Her parents, with true John Bull obstinacy, made
good their word, and shut their doors upon her; but
an uncle, struck perhaps with her courage and constancy,
opened to her an asylum where she remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
till her marriage. In later years her parents became
reconciled to her.</p>

<p>The religious life thus begun was carried on with
a marked and triumphant fullness. She was a woman
of enthusiastic convictions, of strong mind, and of
great natural eloquence, and during the infancy and
childhood of William Lloyd he was often with her in
the prayer-meetings, which were vivified by the electric
eloquence of her prayers and exhortations&mdash;for
the Baptist as well as Methodist denominations, allowed
to women as well as men, a Christian equality
in the use of the gifts of instruction.</p>

<p>The father of Garrison, a man possessed of some
genius and many fascinating and interesting traits, was
one of the victims of intemperance in those days when
so many families were saddened by its blight; and at
quite an early age Mrs. Garrison was left with a family
of helpless little ones, with no other heritage but her
faith in God, and her own undaunted and courageous
spirit. She was obliged to put her boys out at a very
tender age, to struggle for themselves, while she followed
the laborious profession of a sick nurse.</p>

<p>William Lloyd, her second son, was by temperament
fitted to be impressed by a woman like his mother.
He had listened to the burning recital of her experience,
and his heart, even in early infancy, learned
to thrill in sympathy with the solemn grandeur of religious
devotion and absolute self-sacrifice. All his
mother's religious ideas became his own; and even as
a boy he was a strict and well versed Baptist, having
at his tongue's end every argument which supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the peculiar faith which his mother's enthusiasm had
taught him to regard as the only true one.</p>

<p>The necessities of life, however, early separated him
from her society. When only nine years of age he was
placed in the shop of a shoemaker to learn the trade,
but the confinement and employment were unfavorable
to his health and uncongenial to his feelings. He
was longing for educational advantages, and bent on
a career in the world of ideas.</p>

<p>He was taken from this situation and sent to school
at Newburyport, paying for his board and schooling
by sawing wood, doing errands, and performing other
labors out of school hours.</p>

<p>After some unsuccessful experiments at different situations,
he found at last a congenial sphere in being
apprenticed as a printer to Ephraim W. Allen, editor
of the Newburyport <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>His bent had always been for letters, and he engaged
in this occupation with enthusiasm, and that minute and
careful faithfulness and accuracy in regard to the
smallest minutiæ which formed a very marked trait in
his character. In all that relates to the expression of
ideas by the written or printed signs of language, Garrison
had a natural aptitude, and attained to a peculiar
perfection.</p>

<p>His handwriting was, and is, even at this time of
life, as perfect in point of legibility, neatness, and exact
finish, as if he had been by profession a writing-master.</p>

<p>Even in the days when the <i>Liberator</i> was the most
despised and rejected of all papers, the very lowest in
the scale of genteel appreciation, its clear and elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
typography, and the grace and completeness of its mechanical
disposition, won for it admiration. He understood
to a nicety that art which solicits the eye of
a reader, and makes a printed sheet look attractive.</p>

<p>It was not long before his fervid mind began to
reach beyond the mechanical setting of his types, to
the intellectual and moral purposes to be accomplished
through them.</p>

<p>Garrison was one of the ordained priests of nature,
one of the order of natural prophets who feel themselves
to have a message to society, which they must
and will deliver.</p>

<p>He began sending anonymous articles to the paper
on which he was employed, which were well received,
and which, consequently, he had more than once the
pleasure of setting up in type.</p>

<p>Encouraged by their favorable reception, he gradually
began to offer articles to other journals. A series
of articles for the Salem <i>Gazette</i>, under the signature
"Aristides," attracted particular attention, and were
commended by Robert Walsh in the Philadelphia
National <i>Gazette</i>, who attributed them to Timothy
Pickering; a compliment of no small significance to a
young mechanic.</p>

<p>In 1824, his employer, Mr. Allen, was obliged for a
long time to be absent from the charge of his paper,
when Mr. Garrison acted as editor of the Newburyport
<i>Herald</i>, of which he had been previously printer.</p>

<p>In 1826 he became proprietor and editor of a paper
called the <i>Free Press</i>, in his native town. He toiled
at it with unceasing industry, and that patient cheerfulness
of enthusiasm which made every labor light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
He printed his own editorials, <i>without previously writing
them</i>, a fact which more than anything else shows
how completely he had mastered the mechanical part
of his profession. But with all this industry and talent,
the work of keeping up a newspaper of so high
a moral tone as that to which he was always aspiring,
was simply beyond the ability of a poor man,
and he was obliged to relinquish it. He went to Boston
and engaged as a journeyman printer for a time,
till in 1827 he became the editor of the <i>National Philanthropist</i>,
the first journal that advocated total abstinence,
and in 1828 he joined a friend at Bennington,
Vt., in a journal devoted to peace, temperance,
and anti-slavery.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1829, he delivered an address
in Park Street church, Boston, on the subject of slavery.
At that time the subject had taken a deep and
absorbing hold upon his mind. He then regarded the
American Colonization Society's as the most practical
and feasible issue in the case&mdash;an opinion which he
afterwards most fully retracted. At this time he visited
the leading orthodox ministers and editors in and
about Boston. Being himself a child of the church,
he desired to stir up in behalf of the slave that efficiency
of church activity that was effecting so much
in the cause of temperance. Burning with zeal, he
sought the then active leader of the orthodox party,
and begged him to become leader in the movement,
and command the forces in a general anti-slavery crusade.</p>

<p>Dr. Beecher received him favorably, listened to him
courteously, wished him success, but said in regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
himself he had so "many irons in the fire" that he
could not think of putting in another. "Then," said
Garrison, "<i>you had better let all others go, and attend
to this one alone</i>." The results of time have shown
that the young printer saw further than the sages of
his day.</p>

<p>It is worth remembering by those who criticized
Garrison's generalship in leading the anti-slavery cause,
that in the outset he was not in the least ambitious of
being a general, and would willingly have become
<i>aide-de-camp</i> to the ruling forces of the religious world.
That the campaign was carried on out of the church
of New England, and not in and by it, was because
the church and the religious world at that hour were
absorbed in old issues&mdash;old activities and schemes of
benevolence&mdash;and had not grace given them to see
that the great critical national question of the day had
thus been passed out of their hands.</p>

<p>The articles in Garrison's paper, however, attracted
the attention of a little obscure old man, a Quaker,
who was laboring in the city of Baltimore, for the
cause of the suffering slaves, with a devotion and self-sacrifice
worthy of the primitive Christians.</p>

<p>Benjamin Lundy, a quiet, persistent, drab-clothed,
meek old man, one of those valiant little mice who
nibble undismayed on the nets which enchain the
strongest lions, was keeping up, in the city of Baltimore,
an anti-slavery paper which was read only by a
few people who thought just as he did, and which was
tolerated in southern society only because everybody
was good-naturedly sure that it was no sort of matter
what it said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Benjamin, however, took his staff in hand, and
journeyed on foot up to Bennington, Vt., to see the
man who wrote as if he cared for the slave. The
strict Baptist and the meek Quaker met on the common
ground of the cross of Christ. Both were agreed
in one thing; that here was Jesus Christ, in the person
of a persecuted race, hungry, thirsty, sick and in prison,
with none to visit and relieve; and the only question
was, would they arise and go to His help?</p>

<p>So Mr. Garrison went down to the city of Baltimore,
to join his forces with Benjamin Lundy. "But," as
he humorously observed, "I wasn't much help to him,
for he had been all for gradual emancipation, and as
soon as I began to look into the matter, I became convinced
that immediate abolition was the doctrine to
be preached, and I scattered his subscribers like pigeons."</p>

<p>Good little Benjamin took the ruinous zeal of
his new partner with the tolerance which his sect extends
to every brother who "follows his light;" but a
final assault of Garrison on one of the most villainous
aspects of slavery, quite upset the enterprise, and
landed him in prison. The story is in this wise: A
certain ship, the Francis Todd, from Newburyport, came
to Baltimore and took in a load of slaves for the New
Orleans market. All the harrowing cruelties and separations
which attend the rending asunder of families,
and the sale of slaves, were enacted under the eyes of
the youthful philanthropist, and in a burning article he
denounced the inter-state slave trade as piracy, and piracy
of an aggravated and cruel kind, inasmuch as those
born and educated in civilized and Christianized society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
have more sensibility to feel the evils thus inflicted,
than imbruted savages. He denounced the owners
of the ship, and all the parties in no measured terms,
and expressed his determination to "cover with thick
infamy all who were engaged in the transaction."
Then, to be sure, the sleeping tiger was roused, for
there was a vigor and power in the young editor's eloquence
that quite dissipated the good-natured contempt
which had hitherto hung round the paper. He
was indicted for libel, found guilty, of course, condemned,
imprisoned in the cell of a man who had
been hanged for murder. His mother at this time was
not living, but her heroic, undaunted spirit still survived
in her son, who took the baptism of persecution
and obloquy not merely with patience, but with the
joy which strong spirits feel in endurance. He wrote
sonnets on the walls of his prison, and by his cheerful
and engaging manners made friends of his jailor and
family, who did everything to render his situation as
comfortable as possible. Some considerable effort was
made for his release, and much interest was excited in
various quarters for him.</p>

<p>He was finally liberated by Arthur Tappan, who
paid the exorbitant fine for want of which he was
imprisoned. He went out of jail, as people generally
do who are imprisoned for conscience's sake, more devoted
than ever to the cause for which he suffered.
The river of his life, which hitherto had had many
branches, all flowing in the direction of general benevolence,
now narrowed and concentrated itself into one
intense volume, to beat day and night against the prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
walls of slavery, till its foundations should be washed
away, and it should tumble to dust.</p>

<p>He issued a prospectus of an anti-slavery journal at
Washington, and lectured through the northern cities,
and was surprised to find the many and vital cords by
which the Northern States were held from the expression
of the natural feelings of humanity on a subject
whose claims were so obvious. In Boston he in vain
tried to get the use of a hall to lecture in; but a mob
was threatened, and of all the public edifices in the
city, not one could be found whose owner would risk
it until a club of professed infidels came forward, and
offered their hall as a tribute to free speech.</p>

<p>On Jan. 1, 1831, Mr. Garrison issued the first number
of the <i>Liberator</i>. He had no money. The rank,
respectability and religion of Boston alike disowned
him. At first, he and his partner, Isaac Knapp, were
too poor even to hire an office of their own, but the
foreman in the office of the <i>Christian Examiner</i> generously
employed them as journeymen, taking their
labor as compensation for the use of his type. Mr.
Garrison, after working as journeyman printer all day,
spent the greater part of the night in writing and
printing his paper; and under such auspices the first
number came out.</p>

<p>Nothing more remarkable in human literature has
ever appeared than those few memorable paragraphs in
which this obscure, unfriended young mechanic thus
issued his declaration of war against an evil embodied
in the Constitution and protected by the laws of one
of the most powerful nations of the earth. David
meeting Goliath with a sling and stone was nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
it. The words have a prophetic assurance that sounds
solemn in the remembrance of recent events. He
speaks as one having authority:</p>

<p>"During my recent tour for the purpose of exciting
the minds of the people by a series of discourses on
the subject of slavery, every place that I visited gave
fresh evidence of the fact that a greater revolution in
public sentiment was to be effected in the free States&mdash;and
particularly in New England&mdash;than at the South.
I found contempt more bitter, opposition more active,
detraction more relentless, prejudice more stubborn,
and apathy more frozen than among slaveholders
themselves. Of course there were individual exceptions
to the contrary. This state of things afflicted,
but did not dishearten me. I determined, at every
hazard, to lift up the standard of emancipation in the
eyes of the nation, within sight of Bunker Hill, and
in the birth-place of liberty. That standard is now
unfurled; and long may it float, unhurt by the spoliations
of time or the missiles of a desperate foe; yea,
till every chain be broken, and every bondman set
free! Let Southern oppressors tremble; let their secret
abettors tremble; let all the enemies of the persecuted
black tremble. Assenting to the self-evident
truths maintained in the American Declaration of Independence,
'that all men are created equal, and endowed
by their Creator with certain inalienable rights,
among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,'
I shall strenuously contend for the immediate
enfranchisement of our slave population.</p>

<p>"I am aware that many object to the severity of
my language; but is there not cause for severity? I
will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as
justice. On this subject I do not wish to think, or
speak, or write with moderation. No! No! Tell a
man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm;
tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands
of the ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate
her babe from the fire into which it has fallen; but
urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the
present! I am in earnest. I will not equivocate&mdash;I

<p>It is pretended that I am retarding the cause of
emancipation by the coarseness of my invective, and
the precipitancy of my measures. The charge is not
true. On this question, my influence, humble as it is,
is felt at this moment to a considerable extent; and it
shall be felt in coming years&mdash;not perniciously, but
beneficially&mdash;not as a curse, but as a blessing; and <span class="smcap">posterity
will bear testimony that I was right</span>. I desire
to thank God that He enables me to disregard 'the
fear of man which bringeth a snare,' and to speak
truth in its simplicity and power; and I here close
with this dedication:</p>

<p>Just thirty-five years after, on the first of January,
1866, Garrison had the happiness of announcing that
the glorious work to which he had devoted himself
was finally finished; and with humble ascriptions of
all the praise and glory to God, he proclaimed the
cessation of the <i>Liberator</i>. His own son had been a
leader in that conquering army which entered Charleston
amid the shouts of liberated slaves, and the fetters
and hand-cuffs of the slave-mart were sent as
peaceful trophies to the <i>Liberator</i> office in Boston.
Never was it given to any mortal in one generation to
witness a more perfect triumph of a moral enterprise!</p>

<p>But before this triumph came were years of sharp
conflict. Tones so ringing and so resolute, coming
from the poorest den in Boston, could not but find listeners!
The vital instincts of all forms of oppression
are surprisingly acute, and prompt to discriminate afar
what is really a true and what a false alarm. A storm
of agitation began, which swelled, and eddied, and
howled, and shook, and convulsed the nation from
year to year, till the end came.</p>

<p>The first number of the <i>Liberator</i> brought fifty dollars
from James Forten, a colored man of Philadelphia,
and the names of twenty-five subscribers; and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
long an obscure room was rented as an office, where
Garrison and his partner made their bed on the floor,
boarded themselves, and printed their paper.</p>

<p>A Southern magistrate, trembling for the institutions
of his country, wrote a somewhat dictatorial appeal to
the mayor of Boston, Harrison Gray Otis, to suppress
that paper. Mr. Otis wrote in reply, that having ferreted
out the paper and the editor, he found that his
office was an obscure hole, his only visible auxiliary a
negro boy, his supporters a few insignificant persons
of all colors&mdash;from which he argued that there was
no occasion for alarm, even though the obscure paper
should prove irrepressible. Very differently, however,
thought the South. Every mail brought to Garrison
threats of assassination, and letters whose mingled
profanity and obscenity can only be described as John
Bunyan describes the discourse of Apollyon, "He spake
as a dragon." The Governors of one or two States set
a price upon his head. The Governor of Georgia, in
terms somewhat more decent, offered five thousand
dollars to any one who should arrest and bring to trial
under the laws of that State, the editor or publisher
of the <i>Liberator</i>. Many of Mr. Garrison's friends,
deeming his life in danger, besought him to wear arms.
He was, however, from religious conviction, a non-resistant
of evil, interpreting with literal strictness the
Saviour's directions on that subject; and so committed
his life simply to the good providence of God.</p>

<p>On January 1, 1832, he secured the co-operation of
eleven others, who, with himself, organized the American
Anti-Slavery Society upon the principle of immediate
emancipation. Affiliated associations sprang up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
all over the country&mdash;books, tracts, lectures, all the
machinery of moral agitation, began active movement.
He went to England as agent for the Emancipation
Society, to hold counsel with the men who had pioneered
the same work successfully in England. He
was warmly received by Wilberforce, Brougham,
Clarkson, and their associates, and succeeded in opening
their eyes to the entire inefficiency of the Colonization
Society as a substitute for the great duty of
immediate emancipation, so that Wilberforce, with
eleven of his coadjutors, issued a protest against it,
not as in itself considered, but as it had been made a
shield to the consciences of those who deferred their
immediate duty to the slave on the ground of this distant
and precarious remedy.</p>

<p>While in England this time, Mr. Garrison was invited
to Stafford House, and treated with marked attention
by the Duchess of Sutherland, then in the zenith
of that magnificent beauty which, in union with a
generous nature and winning manners, made her one
of the most distinguished leaders among the nobility
of the times. With a heart to feel every grand and
heroic impulse, she had entered with enthusiasm into
the anti-slavery movement of her own country, and
was prepared to welcome the obscure, unknown apostle
of the same faith from American shores. At her
request, Garrison sat for his portrait to one of the
most distinguished artists of the time, and the copy
was retained among the memorabilia of Stafford
House. Garrison humorously remarked that many
had desired to have his head before now, but the solicitation
had never come in so flattering a form. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
noble woman has lived to enjoy the triumph of that
cause in which her large heart gave her that right of
personal possession which belongs to the very highest
natures.</p>

<p>On his return from England he assisted in organizing
the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia,
the declaration of whose principles was prepared by
him. From this time the anti-slavery agitation was
intensified, and the era of mob violence swept over
the country. The holding of an anti-slavery society
in any place was the appointed signal for scenes of
riotous violence. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Hall
was burned, the negroes abused and maltreated. In
Cincinnati, Birney's printing-press and types were
thrown into the Ohio, and the negroes for days were
hunted like beasts. In Alton, Lovejoy was shot while
defending his printing-press, and Boston, notwithstanding
the sepulchres of the fathers, and the shadow of
Bunker Hill spire, had her hour of the powers of darkness.
Leading presses abused the abolitionists in
terms which aroused every vindictive passion of the
mob, and in October, 1835, a meeting of the Female
Anti-Slavery Society of Boston was riotously broken
up by a collection of persons, described in the journals
of the day as "gentlemen of property and standing."</p>

<p>The heroines of that memorable day and time, were
ladies from the very first Massachusetts families; sprung
from the old heroic stock of her historic fame. For
vigor of mind, for education, for beauty, accomplishments
and genius, some of them might be cited who
would scarce find superiors in any land. Their meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
was in every way feminine and proper, and in
strict accordance with the spirit and customs of New
England, which recognize female organizations for various
benevolent purposes, as one of the most approved
means for carrying on society.</p>

<p>There was no more reason why a female Anti-Slavery
Society should not meet quietly, transact its own
business and listen to speeches of its own chosen orators,
than the Female Foreign Missionary Society or
the Female Home Missionary Society, or the Female
Temperance Union.</p>

<p>But certain newspapers of Boston called attention
to the fact that this meeting was so to be held, in articles
written in that well known style which stirs up
and invites that very mobocratic spirit which it pretends
to deprecate.</p>

<p>These papers proceeded to say that those ladies were
about to hold a dangerous kind of meeting, which
would be sure to end in a mob, that they were about
to be addressed by George Thompson, who was declared
to be nothing more nor less than a British agitator,
sent over to make dissension and trouble in
America, and kept here for that purpose by British
funds.</p>

<p>It was now stated in the public prints that several
store keepers in the immediate vicinity of the Hall,
had petitioned the Mayor to suppress the meeting, as in
case of a riot in the neighborhood their property
might be in danger. A placard was posted and circulated
through the city to the following purport, that</p>

<p>'The infamous foreign scoundrel, Thompson, would
hold forth in Anti-Slavery Hall in the afternoon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
that the present was a fair opportunity for the friends
of the Union 'to snake him out;' that a purse of $100
has been subscribed by a number of patriotic citizens
to reward the individual who would lay violent hands
on him, so that he might be brought to the tar kettle
before dark."</p>

<p>In consequence, the Mayor sent a deputy to Mr.
Garrison to know if Mr. Thompson did intend to address
the meeting, for if he did not he wished to apprise
the people of it in order to tranquilize the excitement,
and if he did, it would be necessary to
double the constabulary forces.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrison sent him word that Mr. Thompson was
out of town, and would not be present at the meeting.
The remainder of this scene is best given in Mr. Garrison's
own words:</p>

<p>"As the meeting was to commence at 3 o'clock,
P.&nbsp;M., I went to the hall about twenty minutes before
that time. Perhaps a hundred individuals had already
gathered around the street door and opposite to the
building, and their number was rapidly augmenting.
On ascending into the hall, I found about fifteen or
twenty ladies assembled, sitting with serene countenances,
and a crowd of noisy intruders (mostly young
men) gazing upon them, through whom I urged my
way with considerable difficulty. 'That's Garrison,'
was the exclamation of some of their number, as I
quietly took my seat. Perceiving that they had no intention
of retiring, I went to them and calmly said&mdash;'Gentlemen,
perhaps you are not aware that this is a
meeting of the Boston <i>Female</i> Anti-Slavery Society,
called and intended exclusively for <i>ladies</i>, and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
only who have been invited to address them. Understanding
this fact, you will not be so rude or indecorous
as to thrust your presence upon this meeting. If,
<i>gentlemen</i>,' I pleasantly continued, 'any of you are
<i>ladies</i>&mdash;in disguise&mdash;why, only apprise me of the fact,
give me your names, and I will introduce you to the
rest of your sex, and you can take seats among them
accordingly.' I then sat down, and, for a few moments,
their conduct was more orderly. However, the
stair-way and upper door of the hall were soon densely
filled with a brazen-faced crew, whose behavior
grew more and more indecent and outrageous. Perceiving
that it would be impracticable for me, or any other
person, to address the ladies; and believing, as I was
the only male abolitionist in the hall, that my presence
would serve as a pretext for the mob to annoy the
meeting, I held a short colloquy with the excellent
President of the Society, telling her that I would withdraw,
unless she particularly desired me to stay. It
was her earnest wish that I would retire, as well for
my own safety as for the peace of the meeting. She
assured me that the Society would resolutely but calmly
proceed to the transaction of its business, and leave
the issue with God. I left the hall accordingly, and
would have left the building, if the stair-case had not
been crowded to excess. This being impracticable, I
retired into the Anti-Slavery Office, (which is separated
from the hall by a board partition,) accompanied
by my friend, Mr. Charles C. Burleigh. It was deemed
prudent to lock the door, to prevent the mob from
rushing in and destroying our publications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
In the mean time, the crowd in the street had augmented
from a hundred to thousands. The cry was
for 'Thompson! Thompson!'&mdash;but the Mayor had now
arrived, and, addressing the rioters, he assured them
that Mr. Thompson was not in the city, and besought
them to disperse. As well might he have attempted
to propitiate a troop of ravenous wolves. None went
away&mdash;but the tumult continued momentarily to increase.
It was apparent, therefore, that the hostility
of the throng was not concentrated upon Mr. Thompson
but that it was as deadly against the Society and
the Anti-Slavery cause. The fact is worthy of special
note&mdash;for it incontestably proves that the object of
these 'respectable and influential' rioters was to put
down the cause of Emancipation, and that the prejudice
against Mr. Thompson was only a mere pretext.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the presence and frantic behavior
of rioters in the hall, the meeting of the Society was
regularly called to order by the President. She read
a select and exceedingly appropriate portion of scripture,
and offered a fervent prayer to God for direction
and succour and the forgiveness of enemies and rioters.
It was an awful, sublime and soul-thrilling scene. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
The clear, untremulous tone of that Christian
heroine in prayer, occasionally awed the ruffians into
silence, and was heard distinctly even in the midst of
their hisses, yells and curses&mdash;for they could not long
silently endure the agony of conviction, and their
conduct became furious. They now attempted to
break down the partition, and partially succeeded;
but that little band of women still maintained their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
ground unshrinkingly, and endeavored to transact
their business.</p>

<p>An assault was now made upon the door of the office,
the lower panel of which was instantly dashed to
pieces. Stooping down, and glaring upon me as I sat
at the desk, writing an account of the riot to a distant
friend, the ruffians cried out&mdash;'There he is! That's
Garrison! Out with the scoundrel!' &amp;c., &amp;c. Turning
to Mr. Burleigh I said&mdash;'You may as well open the
door, and let them come in and do their worst.' But
he, with great presence of mind, went out, locked the
door, put the key into his pocket, and by his admirable
firmness succeeded in keeping the office safe.</p>

<p>Two or three constables having cleared the hall and
staircase of the mob, the Mayor came in and <i>ordered</i>
the ladies to desist, assuring them that he could not
any longer guarantee protection, if they did not take
immediate advantage of the opportunity to retire from
the building. Accordingly, they adjourned, to meet
at the house of one of their number, for the completion
of their business; but as they passed through the
crowd, they were greeted with 'taunts, hisses, and
cheers of mobocratic triumph, from gentlemen of property
and standing from all parts of the city.' Even
their absence did not diminish the throng. Thompson
was not there&mdash;the ladies were not there&mdash;but
'<i>Garrison</i> is there!' was the cry. 'Garrison! Garrison!
We must have Garrison! Out with him!
Lynch him!' These and numberless other exclamations
arose from the multitude. For a moment their
attention was diverted from me to the Anti-Slavery
sign, and they vociferously demanded its possession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
It is painful to state, that the Mayor promptly complied
with their demand! So agitated and alarmed had
he become that in very weakness of spirit he ordered
the sign to be hurled to the ground, and it was instantly
broken in a thousand fragments by the infuriated
populace. The sign being demolished the cry for Garrison
was resumed more loudly than ever. It was
now apparent that the multitude would not disperse
till I left the building, and as egress out of the front
door was impossible, the Mayor and some of his assistants
as well as some of my friends earnestly besought
me to escape in the rear of the building. At this
moment an abolition brother, whose mind had been
previously settled on the peace question, in his anguish
and alarm for my safety, and in the view of the helplessness
of the civil authority, said, 'I must henceforth
repudiate the principle of non-resistance. When the
civil arm is powerless, my own rights are trodden in
the dust, and the lives of my friends are put in imminent
peril by ruffians, I will hereafter stand ready to
defend myself and them at all hazards.' Putting my
hand upon his shoulder, I said, 'Hold, my dear brother!
You know not what spirit you are of. Of what
value or utility are the principles of peace and forgiveness,
if we may repudiate them in the hour of peril and
suffering? Do you wish to become like one of those
violent and blood-thirsty men who are seeking my life?
Shall we give blow for blow, and array sword against
sword? God forbid! I will perish sooner than raise
my hand against any man, even in self-defence, and
let none of my friends resort to violence for my protection.
If my life be taken, the cause of emancipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
will not suffer. God reigns&mdash;his throne is undisturbed
by this storm&mdash;he will make the wrath of man to
praise him, and the remainder he will restrain&mdash;his omnipotence
will at length be victorious.'</p>

<p>Preceded by my faithful and beloved friend Mr.
J&mdash;&mdash; R&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;, I dropped from a back window
on to a shed, and narrowly escaped falling headlong
to the ground. We entered into a carpenter's shop,
through which we attempted to get into Wilson's
Lane, but found our retreat cut off by the mob. They
raised a shout as soon as we came in sight, but the
proprietor promptly closed the door of his shop, kept
them at bay for a time, and thus kindly afforded me
an opportunity to find some other passage. I told
Mr. C. it would be futile to attempt to escape&mdash;I
would go out to the mob, and let them deal with me
as they might elect; but he thought it was my duty
to avoid them as long as possible. We then went up
stairs, and finding a vacancy in one corner of the
room, I got into it, and he and a young lad piled up
some boards in front of me, to shield me from observation.
In a few minutes several ruffians broke into the
chamber, who seized Mr. C. in a rough manner, and led
him out to the view of the mob, saying, 'This is not
Garrison, but Garrison's and Thompson's friend, and he
says he knows where Garrison is, but won't tell.' Then
a shout of exultation was raised by the mob, and what
became of him I do not know; though, as I was immediately
discovered, I presume he escaped without material
injury. On seeing me, three or four of the rioters,
uttering a yell, furiously dragged me to the window,
with the intention of hurling me from that height to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
ground; but one of them relented, and said, 'Don't
let us kill him outright.' So they drew me back, and
coiled a rope about my body&mdash;probably to drag me
through the streets. I bowed to the mob, and requesting
them to wait patiently until I could descend, went
down upon a ladder that was raised for that purpose.
I fortunately extricated myself from the rope, and was
seized by two or three of the leading rioters, powerful
and athletic men, by whom I was dragged along bare-headed,
(for my hat had been knocked off and cut in
pieces on the spot,) a friendly voice in the crowd
shouting, 'He shan't be hurt! He is an American!'
This seemed to excite sympathy in the breasts of some
others, and they reiterated the same cry. Blows,
however, were aimed at my head by such as were of
a cruel spirit, and at last they succeeded in tearing
nearly all my clothes from my body. Thus was I
dragged through Wilson's Lane into State street, in
the rear of the City Hall, over the ground that was
stained with the blood of the first martyrs in the cause
of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span> and <span class="smcap">Independence</span>, in the memorable massacre
of 1770; and upon which was proudly unfurled,
only a few years since, with joyous acclamations, the
beautiful banner presented to the gallant Poles by the
young men of Boston! What a scandalous and revolting
contrast! My offence was in pleading for <span class="smcap smaller">LIBERTY</span>&mdash;liberty
for my enslaved countrymen, colored
though they be&mdash;liberty of speech and of the press
for <span class="smcap smaller">ALL</span>! And upon that 'consecrated spot' I was
made an object of derision and scorn.</p>

<p>They proceeded with me in the direction of the
City Hall, the cry being raised, 'To the Common!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
whether to give me a coat of tar and feathers, or to
throw me into the pond, was problematical. As we
approached the south door, the Mayor attempted to
protect me by his presence; but as he was unassisted
by any show of authority or force, he was quickly
thrust aside; and now came a tremendous rush on the
part of the mob to prevent my entering the hall. For
a time the conflict was desperate; but at length a rescue
was effected by a posse that came to the help of
the Mayor, by whom I was carried up to the Mayor's
room.</p>

<p>In view of my denuded condition, one individual in
the Post office below stairs kindly lent me a pair of
pantaloons, another a coat, a third a stock, a fourth a
cap, &amp;c. After a brief consultation, the mob densely
surrounding and threatening the City Hall and Post
Office, the Mayor and his advisers said that my life
depended on committing me to jail, ostensibly as a
disturber of the peace. Accordingly a hack was got
ready at the door and I was put into it, supported by
Sheriff Parkman and Ebenezer Bailey, the Mayor
leading the way. And now ensued a scene which
baffles all description. As the ocean lashed to fury
by a storm, seeks to whelm a bark beneath the waves,
so did the mob, enraged at their disappointment, rush
like a whirlwind upon the frail vehicle in which I sat,
and endeavored to drag me out of it. Escape seemed
a physical impossibility. They clung to the wheels&mdash;dashed
open the doors&mdash;seized hold of the horses&mdash;and
tried to upset the carriage. They were, however,
vigorously repulsed by the police, a constable sprang
in by my side, the doors were closed, and the driver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
using his whip on the bodies of the horses and the
heads of the rioters, happily made an opening through
the crowd, and drove with all speed to Leverett
street.</p>

<p>In a few moments I was locked up in a cell, safe
from my persecutors, accompanied by two delightful
associates, a good conscience and a cheerful mind. In
the course of the evening several of my friends came
to my grated window to sympathise and confer with
me, with whom I held strengthening conversation, till
the hour of retirement, when I threw myself on my
prison bed, and slept tranquilly. In the morning, I
inscribed upon the walls of my cell, with a pencil, the
following lines:</p>

<p>'Wm. Lloyd Garrison was put into this cell on
Wednesday afternoon, Oct. 21, 1835, to save him from
the violence of a "respectable and influential" mob,
who sought to destroy him for preaching the abominable
and dangerous doctrine that "all men are created
equal," and that all oppression is odious in the sight
of God. "Hail, Columbia!" Cheers for the Autocrat
of Russia, and the Sultan of Turkey!</p>

<p>Reader, let this inscription remain till the last slave
in this despotic land be loosed from his fetters.'</p>

<p>In the course of the forenoon, after passing through
the mockery of an examination, for form's sake, before
Judge Whitman, I was released from prison; but, at
the <i>earnest solicitation of the city authorities</i>, in order
to tranquilize the public mind, I deemed it proper to
leave the city for a few days, accompanied by my wife,
whose situation was such as to awaken the strongest
solicitude for her life."</p>

<p>At this distance of time it is difficult to conceive of
such scenes as occurring in Boston. They are to be accounted
for by two things. First, the intense keenness
of the instincts of the Slaveholding power in the
United States, in discriminating from afar what the results
of the Anti-Slavery discussion would be, and the
real power which was arising in the apparently feeble
body of the Abolitionists; and second, the thousand
ties of politics, trade, blood relationship, friendship
and religion that interlaced the South with the North,
and made the North for many years a tool of southern
dictators and a mere reflection of southern sympathies.
There was scarcely a thing in northern society that
was not interwoven and intertwisted with southern
society. Northern schools and colleges were full of
southern scholars&mdash;northern teachers were all the while
seeking places on southern plantations. The great
political bodies had each its southern wing, every
religious denomination had its southern members and
southern interests. Every kind of trade and industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
calling had its southern outlet. The ship builders of
Maine went to Charleston for their cargoes. Plantations
were fitted out at the North, by every kind of
trade. Our mercantile world was truly and in fact
one firm with the South and felt any disturbance to
them as virtually as the South itself.</p>

<p>Hence Garrison's instinctive feeling that the battle
was to be fought <i>in the North</i>, where as yet there was
a free press and the right of free speech.</p>

<p>It was not long before the South perceived that if
free inquiry and free discussion were going to be allowed
in Massachusetts, it would be all over with them,
and like men who were brought up always to have
their own way and had but to command to be obeyed,
several southern states sent immediate and earnest
communications to the Massachusetts Legislature, requesting
the General Court to enact laws making it
penal for the citizens of Massachusetts to form abolition
societies or print and publish abolition sentiments.</p>

<p>The Governor of Massachusetts, in his message to
the Legislature at this time, expressed his belief
that the abolitionists were guilty of an offence punishable
by common law.</p>

<p>This part of the Governor's message, together with
the resolutions from the Legislatures of slaveholding
states, was referred to a committee of five.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society addressed
a memorial to this committee, praying to be permitted
to appear before them and show that they had done
nothing but what they had a perfect constitutional
right to do by the laws of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>On the Fourth and Eighth of March, 1836, these memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
interviews took place at the state house, in the
chamber of the representatives.</p>

<p>A committee of some of the leading abolitionists
attended&mdash;Mr. I. May, Mr. E. Gray Loring, Mr. Sewell,
Dr. Follen, of Harvard College, and Mr. Garrison.
Dr. Channing also met with them as an expression of
sympathy and to mark his sense of the vitally important
nature of the transactions to the rights of personal
liberty in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The meeting was attended by many spectators, and
the abolitionists had opportunity to defend their course
and conduct.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrison's speech at this time is one of the most
energetic and characteristic of his utterances. After
alluding to the duty of all men to plead for the rights
of the dumb and the oppressed, he then went on to
say:</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman, there is one aspect of this great question
which has not yet been presented to the committee.
The liberties of the people of the free States
are identified with those of the slave population. If
it were not so, there would be no hope, in my breast,
of the peaceful deliverance of the latter class from
their bondage. Our liberties are bound together by
a ligament as vital as that which unites the Siamese
twins. The blow which cuts them asunder, will inevitably
destroy them both. Let the freedom of speech
and of the press be abridged or destroyed, and the
nation itself will be in bondage; let it remain untrammelled,
and southern slavery must speedily come to an
end." The chairman of the committee however insulted
the abolitionists, refused them a fair hearing,
and substantially turned them out of the Legislature, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
protest at their leisure. The Legislature however did
not pass the laws demanded by the South.</p>

<p>Miss Martineau, who visited Boston in those days,
described feelingly what she justly called the martyr
age in America.</p>

<p>The abolitionists in Boston at this time, were ostracized
from genteel society. Rank and fashion cut
them in the street, and crossed out their names from
visiting lists. Whoever joined them must expect as a
matter of course to give up what was called in Boston,
good society.</p>

<p>Their houses were constantly threatened by anonymous
letters, nor was the threat a vain one.</p>

<p>One of the most accomplished women of Boston,
whose genius and beauty and fine manners won her a
distinguished position afterwards in European society,
lives to remember now, how her house was fired while
she was still an invalid in her chamber with an infant
daughter only three weeks old, and how she was
obliged to sit by an open window to get air for herself
and infant, from the smoke that filled the house
after the fire had been discovered and brought under.</p>

<p>Now there were in the whole North, thousands of
people who thought slavery a wrong, an inhumanity,
and who wished with a greater or less degree of ardor
that it might cease from the earth. But all these people
were associated for some purpose social, moral or
religious, with people at the South, who were in a state
of feverish combativeness on this subject, who were
accustomed to command from their cradles, impatient
of contradiction, and violent in their passions; and in
every way and form, and every branch of life in state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
and church, the demand was stringent and imperative:
"You shall not say that slavery is wrong&mdash;you shall not
agitate that question or discuss it at all, and you shall
join with us to discountenance and put down all who
endeavor to agitate the public mind. If you don't <i>we</i>
won't have any thing to do with you or your purposes
or schemes."</p>

<p>This was the language which kept the whole North
boiling like a pot for years. On the one hand, the
force of conscience and humanity, and on the other,
the passionate determined resistance of the South operating
through northern men, who, though disliking
slavery yet had their various purposes to carry, for
which they needed the help of the South.</p>

<p>So even the religious societies felt that their great
moral and religious work was so important that they
must yield a little, in order to gain the help of southern
Christians. The Tract Society struck out from
English reprints every line and sentence which might
be supposed to reprove slavery; the Sunday School
Union followed suit. The various religious bodies,
embarrassed by their southern wings, spent their time
in every annual meeting in ingenious skirmishing, in
which the main body sought to keep the peace between
the active minority of abolitionists, and the irritated,
determined, dictatorial southern brethren, whose
sentiments were exactly expressed by Dr. Plummer, of
Virginia:</p>

<p>"If abolitionists will set the world in a blaze, it is
but fair that they should receive the first warming at
the fire. Let them understand that they will be
caught if they come among us, and they will take
good heed to keep out of our way; there is not one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
among them that has any idea of shedding his blood
for his cause."</p>

<p>The ministers of the slaveholding region were driven
on by the unsparing, uncompromising slave-owners,
and were the most high-handed defenders of the system.
Northern religious bodies, in order to carry on
their purposes in union with the South, were obliged
to make constant concessions at which their conscience
revolted. The Methodist church, in 1840, passed a
law forbidding their colored members to give testimony
in church trials in slave States. The debates on
this question are worth looking back to now, as they
give a dramatic reality to the great driving, pushing
process which was then going on in favor of slavery.</p>

<p>A trembling brother, after voting for this astounding
prohibition, which took away the last hope of even a
hearing in Christ's church for the poor hunted slave&mdash;rose
the day after he had helped pass it, and humbly
and plaintively tried to get it taken back.</p>

<p>He said that the resolution "was introduced under
peculiar circumstances, during considerable excitement,
and he went for it as a <i>peace offering to the
South</i>, without sufficiently reflecting upon the precise
import of its phraseology, but after a little deliberation
he was sorry! He was convinced that if the resolution
remained on the journal, it would be disastrous
to the whole Northern church."</p>

<p>Dr. A. J. Few, of Georgia, arose, and it is instructive
to see how resolute men, who have made up their
minds, and know exactly what they mean to do, despise
timid men, who are divided between policy and
conscience. Dr. Few said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
"Look at it! What do you declare to us, in taking
this course! Why, simply, as much as to say, 'We
cannot sustain you in the condition which you cannot
avoid! We cannot sustain you in the <i>necessary conditions</i>
of slaveholding; one of its <i>necessary conditions</i>
being the rejection of negro testimony!' If it is not
sinful to hold slaves, under all circumstances, <i>it is not
sinful to hold them in the only condition, and under the
only circumstances in which they can be held</i>. The rejection
of negro testimony is one of the necessary circumstances
under which slaveholding can exist; indeed,
it is utterly impossible for it to exist without it;
therefore it is not sinful to hold slaves <i>in the condition
and under the circumstances in which they are held
at the South, inasmuch as they can be held under no
other circumstances</i>. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* If you believe that
slaveholding is necessarily sinful, come out with the
abolitionists, and honestly say so. If you believe that
slaveholding is necessarily sinful, you believe we are
necessarily sinners; and if so, come out and honestly
declare it, and <i>let us leave you</i>. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* We want
to know distinctly, precisely and honestly the position
which you take. We cannot be tampered with by
you any longer. We have had enough of it. We
are tired of your sickly sympathies. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* If you
are not opposed to the principles which it involves,
unite with us, like <i>honest men</i>, and go home, and
boldly meet the consequences."</p>

<p>From this it appears that the Southern slaveocracy
was not only a very united, determined body, but also
remarkably logical as to the necessary ways and means
which were essential to the support of their system, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
that not only they were prepared to go the whole
length themselves, but they meant to have nothing to
do with any one who would not go the whole length
with them.</p>

<p>The result of this one victory was to split the Methodist
church in two. Mr. Peck was right in supposing
that there was yet enough conscience in the Northern
Methodists to feel the impossibility of holding a book
of discipline which called slavery "the sum of all villainies,"
and yet keeping union with those who were
making it the first object of life to uphold it. Some
such crisis of conscience, always brought on by the
slave-driving, dictatorial, determined and logical South,
in time rent asunder all the principal denominations
into a northern and southern wing. For however they
might have been disposed towards the policy of non-intervention,
the South never allowed them to stand
long on that ground. They must not only cease to
remonstrate against slavery, but help them by consenting
to positive laws and measures in its defence.
So great was the power of this dictatorial spirit, that
when the New School Presbyterian church had broken
off from the great body of southern churches, who
went with the Old School, yet the one or two synods
who were left among them extorted from the whole
body the decree that "masters ought not to be disciplined
for selling slaves without their consent, even
when fellow members of the same churches with themselves."</p>

<p>Now this history of what went on in the church of
America&mdash;for the church, meaning by it all the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
denominations, did embody as a general fact, the
whole religious and moral force of the country, shows
more strongly than anything else what was likely to be
going on in bodies that did not profess any moral character
or considerations. If this was the state to which
the dictation of the southern slavepower had driven
the church, what was to be hoped of the political
world and the world of trade?</p>

<p>Mr. Garrison looked over this dark field, and saw
the battle&mdash;for there <i>was</i> a battle all over the land&mdash;a
battle in which the truth and the right were being
steadily, daily and everywhere beaten. The church
and the world seemed to be vieing with each other
who could retreat fastest before their victorious masters,
and every day some new right of humanity was
thrown down for the pursuing army to worry and tear&mdash;just
as retreating fugitives throw back a lamb or a
dog to stop a pack of hungry wolves.</p>

<p>Garrison saw at once that the root of all this defeat
and disaster was the desire of <span class="smcap smaller">UNION</span> with slaveholders,
and forthwith he unfurled his banner and sounded his
trumpet to the watchword, <span class="smcap smaller">NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS</span>.</p>

<p>Immediately the Constitution of the United States
was brought up before him. Does not the constitution
form a union with slaveholders? Has it not express
compromises designed to protect slave property?
Is not the basis of representation throughout all the
southern states made on three-fifths of a slave population?
Now Mr. Garrison, what do you say to that?</p>

<p>"What I say," said Garrison, "is, that slavery is a
sin against God and man, and if the constitution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
the United States does agree to defend and protect it,
it is a sinful league, and it is a covenant with death,
and an agreement with hell," and out came the <i>Liberator</i>
with the solemn curses of the old prophets at its
head, and the Garrisonian abolitionists organized
themselves on the principle that they would hold no
union with slaveholders in church or in state, they would
belong to no religious or secular body which did not
treat slavery as a sin against God, and they would lift
up their testimony against every person, party or denomination
in church or in state that made any concession
to the slaveholding power, for the sake of accomplishing
<i>any</i> purpose whatsoever.</p>

<p>Here we see the whole scope of subject-matter for
the <i>Liberator</i>, and for all the lectures and speeches
from the platforms of the Garrisonian abolition societies
for years and years. For as there was scarcely a
thing in society in those days that was not the joint
work of the North and the South, and as the South
<i>never</i> made a concession, of course there was through
all the various ramifications of political, social and religious
life, a continued series of concessions on the
part of the North. These concessions were always,
everywhere unsparingly discussed, reproved and denounced
by the Garrisonians, and so there was controversy
constantly and everywhere.</p>

<p>The ministry of New England, from the days of
President Edwards, had adopted a peculiar and pungent
style of preaching immediate repentance of sin.
They repudiated all half efforts, insensible approaches,
dream-like floatings toward right, and narrowed the
question of individual responsibility down to the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
moment, and urged repentance on the spot as the
duty of all. Garrison had received his early education
in this school, and he drove his preaching of immediate
repentance for the sin of slavery, his requirements
for an instant clearing of the soul from all complicity
with it, with the solemnity of an old Puritan. He
had the whole language of the Old Testament at his
tongue's end, and a text from the old prophets ready
like an arrow on a bow-string, to shoot into every
loop-hole of the concessions and compromises that
were constantly going on. He reproved without fear
or favor, ministers, elders, Christians, statesmen, governors,
authors, and denounced the whole church as
contaminated by the sanction and support it gave to
the accursed thing.</p>

<p>He was denounced in turn by the church as an infidel
and an opposer of religion, but he persisted in
hurling right and left the stern denunciations of the
Old Testament: "When thou sawest a thief, thou <i>consentedst</i>
with him&mdash;thou hast been partaker with adulterers,"
and he declared that the visible union of
church and state with an organization which practiced
systematic robbery on four millions of human beings,
and made legal marriage among them an impossibility,
was in the very highest sense consenting with thieves,
and being made partakers with adultery.</p>

<p>There is not the least doubt that the course of <i>entire</i>
separation from slaveholders in church and state, would
have been a perfect and efficient stop to the evil, could
it have been compassed. Could we once imagine a
state of things in which every man and woman in the
United States who admitted that slavery was an injustice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
should come to the point of refusing all fellowship
or connection with it, either in church or state,
or in any of the traffic or intercourse of life, we should
imagine a state in which there would have been immediately
a majority which could have revised the constitution
of the United States, and cast out the offensive
clauses, as has since been done.</p>

<p>But measures so stringent and thorough, supposed
an education of the public conscience which had not
yet taken place, and the Garrisonian Abolitionists
therefore were always a small minority, extremely unfashionable
and every where spoken against. Small as
they were, they were the indispensables of the great conflict&mdash;its
very heart. Garrison and his band of coadjutors
formed a <i>steady force</i> which acted night and day
with unvarying consistency. While everybody else in
the United States had something else to conserve, some
side issues to make, some other point to carry, Garrison
and his band had but one thing to say&mdash;that American
slavery is a sin; but one thing to do&mdash;to preach
immediate repentance and forsaking of sin. They
withdrew from every organization which could in any
way be supposed to tolerate or hold communion with
it, and walked alone, a small, but always active and
powerful body. They represented the pure, abstract
form of every principle as near as it is possible for it
to be represented by human frailty. Free speech, free
inquiry and freedom of conscience found perfect expression
in their meetings, and the <i>Liberator</i> was the
one paper in which any honest, well-meaning person
might print <i>any</i> conscientious opinion, however contrary
to those generally received in society. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
it became the channel for much crude thought, for
much startling and strange expression; and its circulation
was confined almost entirely to the small party
whose opinions it expressed. A large portion of the
Liberator was every week devoted to extracts cut
from southern papers, giving a vivid picture of the
barbaric state of society, produced by slavery. Here,
without note or comment, came the accounts clipped
from different southern papers, of the assaults, frays
and murders daily perpetrated by white men on each
other in a land where violence was ever above law.
There were, too, the advertisements of slave auctions
and runaway negroes; of blood-hounds kept for human
hunting; while in a weekly corner called the
"Refuge of Oppression," all the violent doctrines of
the most rabid slave holders found every week a faithful
reproduction in their own language. For an exact
picture of the image and body of the most extreme
form of southern slave holding and its results on society,
the <i>Liberator</i> was as perfect a moral daguerreotype
as could be produced.</p>

<p>A solemn instance of the terrible sequence of Divine
retribution has been presented to this generation which
will not soon be forgotten. All this disgusting, harrowing,
dreadful record of cruelty, crime and oppression
which the <i>Liberator</i> went on, year after year, in
vain holding up to the inspection of the North, as being
perpetrated within the bounds of slaveholding
society, was shrunk from as too dreadful and disgusting
to be contemplated.</p>

<p>"We do not wish to have our feelings harrowed;
we do not wish to be appalled and disgusted with records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
of cruelty and crime," was the almost universal
voice of good society at the North, as they went steadily
on, compromising with and yielding to the exactions
of a barbarous oligarchy. God so ordered it in
return, that the cup of trembling which had so long
been drunk by the slave alone, should be put into the
hands of thousands of the sons and daughters of the
free North. Thousands of them were starved, tortured,
insulted, hunted by dogs, separated from home and
friends, and left to linger out a cruel death in life,
through the barbarity of those very slaveholders, with
whose sins we had connived, with whose cruelties
practiced on the helpless negroes we had refused to
interfere. So awful a lesson of the justice of a living
God we trust will never be forgotten. If every northern
man and woman had from the very first been as
careful in regarding the rights of the slave, as determined
to hold no fellowship with evil as Garrison, the
solution of our great national question might have
been a far more peaceful one.</p>

<p>In the days of the great conflict, Mr. Garrison was
accused of being in a bad spirit, of the utterance of
violent, angry and abusive language. A very mistaken
idea of his personal character, in fact, went abroad
in the world.</p>

<p>In his personal intercourse he is peculiarly bland
and urbane, one of the few men capable of conducting
an argument on the most interesting subject without
the slightest apparent excitement of voice or manner,
allowing his adversary every polite advantage
and admitting all his just statements with perfect fairness.
It is said that a fiery young southerner once fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
into a discussion on slavery with him when he was
travelling incog., on board a steamboat. Garrison
quite won his heart by the fairness and courtesy with
which he discussed the subject, and brought him to
admissions which the frank southerner in a good humor
was quite willing to make. On parting he said to
him, "If that Garrison there in Boston were only like
you, we should be more ready to listen to him."</p>

<p>A great deal of this amiability doubtless is owing to
the singular steadiness and healthiness of Garrison's
nervous system. In this he was one of the most peculiarly
constituted men, in whom nature ever combined
traits expressly for a great work. All his personal
habits are those of a methodical unexcitable man, and
not in the least like the hurry and enthusiasm of a fanatic.
He is methodical, systematic and precise in all his arrangements,
neat and careful in respect to the minutest
trifle.</p>

<p>His handwriting is always of the finished completeness
of a writing master, and in the most vehement denunciations,
not a letter was ever misplaced or a comma
or exclamation point, omitted. Every thing he
ever wrote was perfected for the press as it left his
pen. Such habits as these speak a composed and equable
nervous system. In fact, Garrison's nerves never
knew what it was to shiver and vibrate either with
irritation or with fear. He is gifted with the most perfect
imperturbable cheerfulness, which no outward discomposure
seems to have any power to shake.</p>

<p>His politely bowing to the furious Boston mob before
descending to put himself in their hands, is a very
characteristic thing, and during all the tossings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
tumults of the hour that followed, Garrison was probably
the serenest person that ever had his clothes torn
off his back for expressing his opinions.</p>

<p>That language in the Liberator which looked to the
world as if it must have been uttered in a passion, because
it was so far above the usual earnestness of expression
on such subjects, was in his case the result of
a deliberate system.</p>

<p>Garrison said that the world blinded conscience and
made false issues with itself by the habitual calling
of things by the wrong names; that there was no
kind of vice which might not be disguised under a
polite phrase. Theft might be spoken of as an ingenious
transfer of property&mdash;adultery as a form of the
elective affinity, and so on, but that all such phraseology
had an immoral tendency.</p>

<p>In like manner the stealing of men and women from
Africa&mdash;the systematic appropriation of all the fruits
of their industry and labor&mdash;was robbery. Whoever
did this was a thief.</p>

<p>Garrison called slaveholders, no matter of what rank
in society, of what personal amiabilities and virtues, man-thieves.
Whoever formed union with slaveholders,
united with man-thieves, and as the partaker in
law is judged as being a thief, those who united with
man-thieves became themselves thieves.</p>

<p>Having reasoned this out logically, Garrison steadily
and systematically applied these terms wherever he
thought they applied. The Garrisonian tract, "The
church a den of thieves," is a specimen of this kind
of logic, and this unsparing use of terms. Whatever
may be thought of the justice of such reasoning or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
propriety of such logical application of terms, we still
wish the fact to stand out clear, that these denunciations
were not boiled up by heated passions, but reasoned
out by logic, and that it was a part of a systematic
plan to bring back the moral sense of society
by a habit of calling things by discriminating names.
Thus in the Liberator every agent of the United States
who helped to catch and return a slave was always
spoken of as a kidnapper&mdash;all defences of the fugitive
slave law were familiarly denominated defences of
kidnapping. Theodore Parker, in his sermons about
the time of the fugitive slave law, makes very effective
use of these terms, and it is not to be denied that
the habit of thus constantly using language which in
a word makes a moral discrimination is a very powerful
influence in forming popular opinion.</p>

<p>People will boggle a great while about fulfilling
constitutional obligation when catching a slave is put
in those terms, but when it is put as "kidnapping,"
the question becomes far more direct and simple. The
Garrisonians doubtless were philosophical in the precision
of the moral nomenclature they adopted, and
their success in stimulating drugged and paralyzed
moral sentiment was largely owing to it.</p>

<p>To be sure, in the application of wholesale moral
syllogism to particular individual cases, there was
often something that appeared extremely hard and
unjust to the individual. When an amiable northern
Doctor of Divinity, who never owned a slave in his
life and never expected to, found himself cited in the
Liberator by the familiar designation of a man-thief,
because he had been in the General Assembly, good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
naturedly uniting with a large body of southern slaveholders
in suppressing all inquiry into their great systematic
robbery, the northern Doctor was naturally
indignant and so were all his friends and adherents.</p>

<p>To be sure it was only a skillful turning of that syllogistic
crank by which New England theology demonstrated
that every individual not conscious of a certain
moral change of heart, was a malignant enemy of God,
and had not a spark of moral excellence of any kind,
no matter what sort of a man he might be, or what
moral virtues he might practice.</p>

<p>Garrison simply reversed the crank and turned this
unsparing kind of logic back on the church and clergy,
who felt some of the surprise and pain of the eagle in
the fable who found himself shot through by an arrow
feathered from his own wing; and in both cases it may
be doubted whether great moral syllogisms do not
involve many instances of individual and personal injustice.</p>

<p>But it is best to let Garrison state his own case as
he did in the Liberator:</p>

<p>"I am accused of using hard language. I admit the
charge. I have not been able to find a soft word to
describe villainy, or to identify the perpetrator of it.
The man who makes a chattel of his brother&mdash;what is
he? The man who keeps back the hire of his laborers
by fraud&mdash;what is he? They who prohibit the
circulation of the Bible&mdash;what are they? They who
compel three millions of men and women to herd together,
like brute beasts&mdash;what are they? They who
sell mothers by the pound, and children in lots to suit
purchasers&mdash;what are they? I care not what terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
are applied to them, provided they do apply. If they
are not thieves, if they are not tyrants, if they are not
men-stealers, I should like to know what is their true
character, and by what names they may be called. It
is as mild an epithet to say that a thief is a thief, as it
is to say that a spade is a spade.</p>

<p>"The anti-slavery cause is beset with many dangers;
but there is one which we have special reason to apprehend.
It is that this hollow cant about hard language
will insensibly check the free utterance of
thought and close application of truth which have
characterized abolitionists from the beginning. As
that cause is becoming popular, and many may be induced
to espouse it from motives of policy rather than
from reverence for principle, let us beware how we
soften our just severity of speech, or emasculate a
single epithet. The whole scope of the English language
is inadequate to describe the horrors and impurities
of slavery. Instead therefore, of repudiating
any of its strong terms, we rather need a new and
stronger dialect.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"The cry of hard language has become stale in my
ears. The faithful utterance of that language has, by
the blessing of God, made the anti-slavery cause what
it is, ample in resources, strong in numbers, victorious
in conflict. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Soft phrases and honeyed accents
were tried in vain for many a year;&mdash;they had
no adaptation to the subject. 'Canst thou draw out
the leviathan, Slavery, with a hook? or his tongue
with a cord which thou lettest down? Canst thou put
a hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
thorn? Will he make many supplications unto thee?
wilt thou take him for a servant forever? Shall not
one be cast down at the sight of him? Out of his
nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out
of his mouth. His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as
hard as a piece of the nether mill-stone. When he
raiseth up himself, even the mighty are afraid. He
esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.'
O, the surpassing folly of those 'wise and prudent'
men, who think he may be coaxed into a willingness
to be destroyed, and who regard him as the gentlest
of all fish&mdash;provided he be let alone! They say it
will irritate him to charge him with being a leviathan;
he will cause the deep to boil like a pot. Call him a
dolphin, and he will not get angry! If I should call
these sage advisers by their proper names, no doubt
they would be irritated too."</p>

<p>The era of mob violence, which swept over the
country in consequence of the anti-slavery agitation,
led to a discussion of the peace question, in which
Garrison took an earnest part as a champion of the
principles of non-resistance, and in 1838 he led the
way in organizing the New England Non-Resistance
Society, whose declaration of sentiments was prepared
by him. The active part taken by the women of the
country in these moral changes, led to a discussion of
the rights of women. Mr. Garrison was at once an
advocate for the principle that women should be allowed
liberty to do whatever God and nature qualified
them to do&mdash;to vote, to serve on committees, and to
take part in discussions on equal terms with the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
sex. Upon this principle there was a division in the
Anti-Slavery Society in 1840; and in the World's
Anti-Slavery Convention, held that year in London,
Mr. Garrison, being delegate from that society, refused
to take his seat because the female delegates
from the United States were excluded. Probably no
act of Mr. Garrison's eventful life was a more difficult
and triumphant exercise of consistent principle than
this.</p>

<p>He had come over to England for sympathy, for at
home he was despised, and rejected, and hated, and
Exeter Hall was filled with an applauding, tumultuous
crowd, ready to make him the lion of the hour,
but not ready to receive his female coadjutors.</p>

<p>As usual, Mr. Garrison conferred not with flesh and
blood for a moment, but rose, bade farewell to the
society, and leaving his protest, walked out serenely
through the crowd, and thus sealed his protest in favor
of the equal rights of woman.</p>

<p>The consideration that he thus renounced an overwhelming
public sympathy, and cut himself loose from
the patronage of all good society in England, could
not weigh a moment with him in comparison with a
principle, and the doctrine of the moral, social and
political equality of woman may be said to have found
in Garrison its first public champion.</p>

<p>The question now arises: If Garrison and his little
band were indeed morally right in their position&mdash;<i>No
union with slaveholders</i>, on what ground did the
whole valiant anti-slavery corps proceed who did not
come out from the church or the state, but saw their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
way clear to remain in existing organizations, and
fight in and by them.</p>

<p>The free soil party of the political abolitionists generally
were headed by men of pure and vital moral
sense, who believed just as sincerely as Mr. Garrison
that slavery was a wrong and an injustice. How then
could they avoid the inference that they could have
no union with slaveholders? The statement of this
ground properly belongs to the biographical sketches
of Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson, which will immediately
follow this.</p>

<p>The Garrisonians, and Mr. Garrison at their head,
had so perfect an instinct in their cause that they
always could feel when a party was at heart morally
sincere and in earnest. So, though they always most
freely and most profusely criticised the works and
ways of the political abolitionists, they were on the
whole on excellent terms with them.</p>

<p>They had gotten up such a name for speaking just
their minds of every body and thing, that their privilege
of criticism came to be allowed freely, and on
the whole the little band was thought by the larger
one to do good political work by their more strictly
and purely moral appeals to the conscience of the
community. Where there had been pretty active
Garrisonian labor in lecturing, came in the largest political
vote.</p>

<p>It is but justice to say that Mr. Garrison's conduct
throughout his course demonstrated that it was not a
constitutional love of opposition, or a delight in fault-finding
which inspired his denunciations of slavery
and of the Union as the defence of slavery. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
from the time of the Emancipation Proclamation, Garrison
became a warm, enthusiastic Unionist. When
the United States flag, cleansed of all stain of slavery,
was once more erected on Fort Sumter, Garrison
made the voyage down to testify by his presence at the
scene his devotion and loyalty to the flag of his country.</p>

<p>Garrison's non-resistant principles did not allow him
to take any active part in the war. But in the same
manner they caused him to allow perfect and free toleration
to such of his sons as desired to enter the
army. The right of individual judgment in every
human being was always sacred with him, and the
military command which took possession of Charleston
had among its officers a son of William Lloyd Garrison.</p>

<p>The scene in the Boston Music Hall, on the 1st of
January, 1864, when the telegraphic dispatch of the
Emancipation Proclamation was received by an enthusiastic
concourse of citizens, and welcomed by the first
literary talent of Boston, was one of those occurrences
of the visible triumph of good men in their day and
generation, of which the slavery conflict gives many
instances.</p>

<p>This scene was in all respects a remarkable one, as
marking the moral progress of Boston, but in order to
feel its full power we must again run our eye over the
events of the past few years, of which it was the outcome.</p>

<p>It was only thirty-four years since the Legislature
of Georgia had passed an act signed by Gov. Lumpkin,
offering the sum of five thousand dollars for whoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
would bring into the State of Georgia the person
of William Lloyd Garrison, there to answer to the
laws of Georgia for the publication of the <i>Liberator</i>&mdash;an
"incendiary sheet." Everybody knew that this
proclamation meant a short shrift and a long rope to
Garrison, but there was at that time no counter movement
on the part of his own State for his protection,
no official declaration on the part of the Massachusetts
Legislature to certify that she considered offering rewards
for the kidnapping of her citizens to be a violation
of State rights. In fact, so completely was Garrison,
thus threatened by the South, unprotected by
law and public sentiment at the North, that five years
later, when the outcry from slaveholding legislatures
became stronger, a Massachusetts Governor actually
recommended imposing pains and penalties on the
abolitionists for the discussion of the subject, and the
Legislature actually took into discussion the propriety
of doing so.</p>

<p>Was ever thirty years productive of a greater moral
change than this 1st of January, 1864, witnessed?</p>

<p>An assemblage of all that Boston had to show of
intellect, scholarship, art, rank and fashion, all came
together of one accord to one place to celebrate the
triumph of those great principles for which Garrison
had once been dragged with a rope ignominiously
through the streets of Boston.</p>

<p>Now that serene head, with its benevolent calmness,
rising in one of the most conspicuous and honored
seats in the house, was the observed of all observers.
The hisses of mob violence, the scoffs and sneers, had
changed to whispered tributes all over the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
"There he is, look!" and mothers pointed him to
their children. "There is the good man who had the
courage to begin this glorious work, years ago!"</p>

<p>Of Garrison's appearance at this time, it is sufficient
to say that it was no more nor less serene and untroubled
than when he stood amid the hisses of the
mob in Faneuil Hall. He had always believed in this
victory as steadfastly in the beginning as in the end,
for God, who makes all his instruments for his own
purposes, had given him in the outset that "faith
which is the substance of things hoped for, and the
evidence of things not seen," and to God alone, without
a thought of self, did he ascribe the glory.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1865, Mr. Garrison having
finished the work for which the Liberator was established
in Boston, came out with his last editorial announcing
the discontinuing of that paper. He says:</p>

<p>"The object for which the <i>Liberator</i> was commenced&mdash;the
extermination of chattel slavery&mdash;having
been gloriously consummated, it seems to me specially
appropriate to let its existence cover the historic period
of the great struggle; leaving what remains to be
done to complete the work of emancipation to other
instrumentalities, (of which I hope to avail myself,)
under new auspices, with more abundant means and
with millions instead of hundreds for allies.</p>

<p>"Most happy am I to be no longer in conflict with
the mass of my fellow-countrymen on the subject of
slavery. For no man of any refinement or sensibility
can be indifferent to the approbation of his fellow-men,
if it be rightly earned. But to obtain it by going
with the multitude to do evil, is self-degradation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
and personal dishonor. Better to be always in a minority
of one with God&mdash;branded as a madman, incendiary,
fanatic, heretic, infidel&mdash;frowned upon by the
powers that be, and mobbed by the populace&mdash;or
consigned ignominiously to the gallows, like him
whose 'soul is marching on,' though his 'body lies
mouldering in the grave,' or burnt to ashes at the
stake, like Wickliffe, or nailed to the cross, like Him
who 'gave himself for the world,' in defence of the
RIGHT, than like Herod, having the shouts of the multitude
crying, 'It is the voice of a god, and not of a
man!'</p>

<p>"Commencing my editorial career when only twenty
years of age, I have followed it continuously till I have
attained my sixtieth year&mdash;first in connection with <i>The
Free Press</i>, in Newburyport, in the spring of 1826;
next, with <i>The National Philanthropist</i>, in Boston, in
1827; next, with <i>The Journal of the Times</i>, in Bennington,
Vt., in 1828&ndash;9; next, with <i>The Genius of
Universal Emancipation</i>, in Baltimore, in 1829&ndash;30; and
finally, with the <i>Liberator</i>, in Boston, from the 1st of
January, 1831, to the 1st of January, 1866,&mdash;at the
start, probably the youngest member of the editorial
fraternity in the land, now, perhaps, the oldest, not in
years, but in continuous service,&mdash;unless Mr. Bryant,
of the New York <i>Evening Post</i>, be an exception.</p>

<p>"Whether I shall again be connected with the press,
in a similar capacity, is quite problematical; but at my
period of life, I feel no prompting to start a new journal
at my own risk, and with the certainty of struggling
against wind and tide, as I have done in the
past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
"I began the publication of the <i>Liberator</i> without a
subscriber, and I end it&mdash;it gives me unalloyed satisfaction
to say&mdash;without a farthing as the pecuniary result
of the patronage extended to it during thirty-five
years of unremitted labors.</p>

<p>"From the immense change wrought in the national
feeling and sentiment on the subject of slavery, the
<i>Liberator</i> derived no advantage at any time in regard
to its circulation.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">There were those in the party of the Garrisonian
Abolitionists whose course at this time seemed to justify
the popular impression that faultfinding had so
long been their occupation, that they were not willing
to accept even their own victory at the price of giving
up their liberty of denunciation. It is doubtless
very dangerous to the finer tissues of one's moral nature
to live only to deny and contend and rebuke.</p>

<p>But Mr. Garrison showed conclusively that it was
love of right and not love of contention, that animated
him by this prompt, whole hearted acknowledgment
of the good when it came. No American citizen
ever came more joyfully and lovingly into the great
American Union, than he who so many years had
stood outside of it, for conscience' sake; and he showed
just as much steadiness and independence in disregarding
the criticisms of some of his former coadjutors,
as he formerly had in disregarding those of pro-slavery
enemies. He would not say that a work was <i>not</i> done
which <i>was</i> done&mdash;he was honest and fair in acknowledging
honest and fair work, and he very wisely distinguished
between emancipation, as a fixed and final
fact, and reconstruction, as belonging to the new era
founded on emancipation. In his last editorial he very
quietly and sensibly states his views on this subject,
and repels the charge which had been made that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
was deserting the battle before the victory was won.
He ends by saying:</p>

<p>"I shall sound no trumpet and make no parade as to
what I shall do for the future. After having gone
through with such a struggle as has never been paralleled
in duration in the life of any reformer, and for
nearly forty years been the target at which all poisonous
and deadly missiles have been hurled, and having
seen our great national iniquity blotted out, and freedom
'proclaimed throughout all the land to all the
inhabitants thereof,' and a thousand presses and pulpits
supporting the claims of the colored population
to fair treatment where not one could be found to do
this in the early days of the anti-slavery conflict, I might,
it seems to me&mdash;be permitted to take a little repose in
my advanced years, if I desired to do so. But, as yet,
I have neither asked nor wished to be relieved of any
burdens or labors connected with the good old cause.
I see a mighty work of enlightenment and regeneration
yet to be accomplished at the South, and many
cruel wrongs done to the freedmen which are yet to
be redressed; and I neither counsel others to turn
away from the field of conflict, under the delusion that
no more remains to be done, nor contemplate such a
course in my own case."</p>

<p>Mr. Garrison's health, which had suffered severely
from his long labors, required the relief of foreign
travel.</p>

<p>He once more revisited England, where his course
was one unbroken triumph. A great breakfast was
given in his honor at St. James' Hall, London, at which
John Bright presided. The Duke of Argyle presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
a complimentary address to Mr. Garrison, congratulating
him on the successful termination of the Anti-Slavery
struggle. Lord John Russell seconded this
address, and at this time magnanimously retracted certain
hasty sayings in regard to the recent conflict in
America, at its commencement. In the city of Edinburgh
he was received in a crowded public meeting
with tumultuous cheering, and the freedom of the city
was solemnly presented to him by the Lord Provost
and magistracy. In a private letter he says:</p>

<p>"I need not tell you that I went to England with no
purpose or thought of being lionized, but only quietly
to see old friends, to seek recreation, hoping to renovate
my failing health by the voyage. But I shall
ever gratefully remember those friendly manifestations
towards me and my native land."</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is but justice to human nature in
general and to New England in particular, to say that
the poets of New England, true to a divine inspiration
always honored Garrison, even in his days of deepest
darkness and rebuke. Longfellow, Russell, Lowell,
Whittier and Emerson, came out boldly with Anti-Slavery
poems. They were the wise men, star-led,
who brought to the stable and the manger of the infant
cause, the gold, frankincense and myrrh. It was
a great opportunity, and they had grace given them to
use it, and not all the fame they had won otherwise,
honors them so much as those tributes to humanity
and liberty which they bestowed in the hour of her
utmost need.</p>

<p>We will conclude this sketch by a letter from Mr.
Garrison, which best shows the spirit in which he regards
the result of the great conflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Stowe</span>:</p>

<p>For your very appreciative and congratulatory letter
on the "marvellous work of the Lord," which the
Liberator marks as finished, I proffer you my heartfelt
thanks, and join with you in a song of thanksgiving
to Him, who, by a mighty hand and an outstretched
arm has set free the captive millions in our
land.</p>

<p>"The instrumentalities which the God of the oppressed
has used for the overthrow of the slave system,
have been as multifarious and extraordinary as that
system has been brutal and iniquitous. Every thing
that has been done, whether to break the yoke or to
rivet it more strongly, has been needed to bring about
the great result. The very madness of the South has
worked as effectively anti-slavery-wise as the most
strenuous efforts of the abolitionists.</p>

<p>"The outlawry of all Northern men of known hostility
to slavery&mdash;the numberless pro-slavery mobs and
lynchings, her defiant and awful defence of the traffic
in human flesh, her increasing rigor and cruelties towards
the slaves, and finally her horrible treason and rebellion
to secure her independence as a vast slaveholding
empire, through all time, all mightily helped to defeat
her impious purpose and to hasten the year of
jubilee. Thus it is that</p>

<p>In the example of Abraham Lincoln we have shown
the working man, self-educated, rising to greatness and
station, under influences purely American. It is our
pride to say that in no other country of the world
could a man of the working classes have had a career
like that of Lincoln.</p>

<p>We choose now another name made famous by the
great struggle for principle and right which has ended
in our recent war. As Lincoln is a specimen of the
facilities, means of self-education and advance in life
which America gives to the working man, so Charles
Sumner is a specimen of that finish, breadth, and extent
of culture which could be produced by the best
blood and the best educational institutions of the
oldest among the <i>free</i> States of America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
We may speak properly of the blood of the Sumner
family, for they belong to what Dr. Oliver Wendell
Holmes so happily characterizes as the "Brahmin caste
of New England," that "harmless, inoffensive, untitled
aristocracy," in whom elevated notions of life, and
aptitudes for learning, seem, in his own words, to be
"hereditary and congenital." "Families whose names
are always on college catalogues; and who break out
every generation or two in some learned labor which
calls them up after they seem to have died out." A
glance at the Cambridge catalogue will show a long
line of Sumners, from 1723 down to the graduation of
our present Senator.</p>

<p>Like many other American families distinguished for
energy and intellectual vigor, the Sumner family can
trace back their lineage to the hardy physical stock of
the English yeomanry. The race, afterwards emigrating
to Oxfordshire, had its first origin in Kent, and it
is curious to see how to this day it preserves physical
traits of its origin. The Kentish men were tall, strong,
long-limbed, and hardy, much relied on for archery
and holding generally the front of the battle. The
Sumners in America have been marked men in these
same physical points; men of commanding stature
and fine vital temperament, strong, athletic, and with
the steady cheerfulness of good health and good digestion.</p>

<p>One of the early ancestors of this family, who lived
in Roxbury, is thus characterized in the Antiquarian
Register: "Never was there a man better calculated
for the sturdy labors of a yeoman. He was of colossal
size and equal strength of muscle, which was kept in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
tone by regularity and good habits. He shrunk from
no labor, however arduous and fatiguing it might seem
to others. Instances of the wonderful feats of strength
performed by him were related after his death by his
contemporaries in his native place and the vicinity."</p>

<p>The son of this man was the venerated Increase
Sumner, the cousin of Charles Sumner's father, one of
the most distinguished Judges and Governors of Massachusetts.
He was indeed one of the nursing fathers
of the State of Massachusetts during the critical period
when, just emerging from the tutelage of England,
she was trying the experiment of a State constitutional
government.</p>

<p>Some of the sayings of Increase Sumner are important,
as showing of what stock it was that our present
Massachusetts Senator came, and what were the family
traditions in which he was educated. In a letter just
in the beginning of the revolutionary war, he says:</p>

<p>"The man who, regardless of public happiness, is
ready to fall in with base measures, and sacrifice conscience,
honor and his country, merely for his own
advancement, must (if not wretchedly hardened,) feel
a torture, the intenseness of which nothing in this
world can equal."</p>

<p>Again, in one of his judicial charges, he says:</p>

<p>"America furnishes one of the few instances of
countries where the blessings of civil liberty and the
rights of mankind have been the primary objects of
their political institutions; in which the rich and poor
are equally protected; where the rights of conscience
are fully enjoyed, and where merit and ability can be
the only claim to the favor of the public. May we not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
then pronounce that man destitute of the true principles
of liberty and unworthy the blessing of society,
who does not at all times lend his aid to support and
maintain a government on the preservation of which
depends his own political as well as private happiness?"</p>

<p>Never was a Governor of Massachusetts carried to
the chair with more popular enthusiasm than Increase
Sumner, to which, doubtless, his stately person and
appearance of high physical vigor added greatly.
Hancock had been crippled with gout, and Adams had
been bent with infirmity, and the populace, ever prone
to walk by sight, were cheered by the stately steppings
of their new leader. "Thank God, we have got
a Governor <i>that can walk</i>, at last," said an old apple
woman, as he passed in state at the head of the legislative
body, from hearing the election sermon in the
Old South.</p>

<p>The father of Charles Sumner was no less distinguished
for the personal and mental gifts of the family.
He was an able lawyer, and for many years filled the
office of high sheriff of Suffolk county, and is still
spoken of with enthusiasm by those who remember
him, as a magnificent specimen of a man of the noblest
type; noble in person, in manners and in mind, and of
most immaculate integrity. He was the last high sheriff
who retained the antique dress derived from English
usage, and the custom well became his lordly person
and graceful dignity of manner.</p>

<p>Charles Sumner, therefore, succeeded to physical
vigor, to patriotic sentiment and noble ideas as his
birthright. His education was pursued in the Boston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Latin school and in Phillips Academy, which is still
proud of the tradition of his sojourn, and lastly in
Harvard College, where he graduated in 1830.</p>

<p>In the same place he pursued his law studies, under
Judge Story, and was admitted to the bar in 1834. No
young man could rise more rapidly. He soon gained
a large practice, and was appointed reporter of the
Circuit Court of the United States, in which capacity
he published three volumes, known as Sumner's Reports,
containing the decisions of Judge Story. He
also edited the <i>American Jurist</i>, a quarterly law journal.
The first three winters after his admission to the bar he
lectured in the Cambridge Law School with such approval
that in 1836, he was offered a professorship in
the Law School, which he declined.</p>

<p>In 1837 he visited Europe for purposes of travel
and general improvement, and remained there for three
years, returning in 1840. As the result of this sojourn,
he added to his previous classical and legal
knowledge an extensive and accurate acquaintance
with the leading languages and literature of modern
Europe. Possessed of a memory remarkable for its
extent and accuracy, all these varied treasures were
arranged in his mind where they could be found at a
moment's notice. We have heard of his being present
once at a dinner, among the Cambridge <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i>, when
Longfellow repeated some French verses, which he
said had struck him by their euphony and elegance, but
to which he could not at the moment assign the name
of the author. Sumner immediately rose from the
table, took down a volume of Voltaire, and without a
moment's hesitation turned to the passage. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
sometimes been accused of a sort of pedantry in the
frequent use of classical and historical illustration in
his speeches, but the occurrence of these has been the
result of a familiarity which made their use to him the
most natural and involuntary thing in the world.</p>

<p>In the outset of Sumner's career it was sometimes
said of him that he was a brilliant theorizer, but that
he would never be a practical politician. His mind,
indeed, belongs to that class whose enthusiasms are
more for ideas and principles than for men. He had
the capacity of loving the absolute right, abstracted
from its practical uses. There was a tendency in his
mind to seek ideal perfection and completeness. In
study, his standard was that of the most finished scholarship;
in politics and the general conduct of life it
was that of the severest models of the antique, elevated
and refined by Christianity.</p>

<p>He returned to his native city at a time when the
intention in good faith to be an ideal patriot and Christian,
was in the general estimation of good society, a
mark of a want of the practical faculties. The Whig
party, in whose ranks, by birth and tradition, he belonged,
looked upon him as the son of their right
hand; though they shook their heads gently at what
seemed to them the very young and innocent zeal with
which he began applying the weights and measures of
celestial regions to affairs where, it was generally conceded,
it would be fatal to use them.</p>

<p>Just at this season, the great Babylon, which now
is cast down with execration, sat as a queen at Washington,
and gave laws, and bewitched northern politicians
with her sorceries. Church and State were entangled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
in her nets, and followed, half willingly, half
unwilling, at her chariot wheels. The first, loudest,
most importunate demand of this sorceress was, that the
rule "Do unto others as ye would that others should
do unto you" should be repealed. There was no objection
to its forming a part of the church service, and
being admired in general terms, as an ideal fragment
of the apostolic age, but the attempt to apply it to the
regulation of national affairs was ridiculed as an absurdity,
and denounced as a dangerous heresy.</p>

<p>What then was the dismay of Beacon Street, the consternation
of State Street, when this young laurelled
son of Cambridge, fresh from his foreign tour, with
all his career of honor before him, showed symptoms
of declining towards the abolitionists. The abolitionists,
of all men! Had not Garrison been dragged by
a halter round his neck through the streets of Boston?
And did not the most respectable citizens cry, Well
done? Was it not absolute social and political death
to any young man to fall into those ranks?</p>

<p>Had not the Legislature of the sovereign state of
Georgia in an official proclamation signed by their
governor, set a price on Garrison's head as an incendiary,
and had not a Governor of Massachusetts in his
message to a Massachusetts Legislature, so far sympathized
with his southern brethren as to introduce into
his inaugural a severe censure of the abolitionists, and
to intimate his belief that in their proceedings they
were guilty of an offence punishable by common law?
Had not Massachusetts legislatures taken into respectful
consideration resolutions from slaveholding legislatures,
dictating to them in that high style for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
such documents are famous, that they should pass laws
making it penal to utter abolitionist sentiments?</p>

<p>All this had been going on during the three years
while Sumner was in Europe, and now, when he was
coming home to take his place as by right in the political
ranks, did it not become him to be very careful
how he suffered indiscreet moral enthusiasm to betray
him into expressions which might identify him with
these despised abolitionists? Was not that socially to
forfeit his birthright, to close upon him every parlor
and boudoir of Beacon Street, to make State Street
his enemy, to shut up from him every office of advancement
or profit, and make him for every purpose
of the Whig party a useless impracticable instrument?</p>

<p>And so the rising young man was warned to let
such things alone; not to strive for the impossible ambrosia
of the higher morals, and to content himself
like his neighbors, with the tangible cabbage of compromise,
as fitted to our mortal state.</p>

<p>He was warned with fatherly unction, by comfortable
old Whigs, who to-day are shouting, even louder
than he, "Down with Babylon, raze it, raze it to the
foundations!"</p>

<p>But in spite of such warnings and cautions, Sumner
became an ardent and thoroughgoing anti-slavery man,
and did not hesitate to avow himself an abolitionist and
to give public utterance to his moral feelings, contrary
to the stringent discipline of the Whig party.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1844, Sumner pronounced in
Boston, in view of the threatening Mexican war, an
oration on "The True Grandeur of Nations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
This discussed the general questions of war from
the Christian stand point, and deprecated the threatened
one on Christian principles. It might have
passed as a harmless peace tract in ordinary times,
but just at this period, it was too evidently the raising
a standard against Babylon to be considered acceptable
doctrine, for had not Babylon issued a decree that
Gospel or no Gospel, a war with Mexico must take
place, so that she might gain more slave territory?
Let the young man look to himself, applying such impossible,
impracticable tests to such delicate political
questions! The speech, however, was widely circulated,
both here and in England, and was said by Cobden
to be one of the noblest contributions ever made
to the cause of peace.</p>

<p>November 4, 1845, Sumner spoke more decidedly
against the Mexican war, in a public meeting at Faneuil
Hall, and the next year came out boldly in the
Whig convention with an address, on "The Anti-Slavery
Duties of the Whig Party."</p>

<p>In this speech, Sumner, as openly as Garrison, declared
himself the eternal opponent of slavery, and
defined his position and marked out his work <i>within</i>
the constitution of the United States, and <i>by</i> the constitution,
just as Garrison had marked out his work
outside of the constitution, and against it.</p>

<p>Sumner took the ground that the constitution of
the United States was not a covenant with death, or
an agreement with hell, but an instrument designed to
secure liberty and equal rights, and that the present
sanction and encouragement it was giving to slavery
was owing to a perversion of its original design. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
maintained that the constitution nowhere recognises
slavery as an institution, that the slave is nowhere
spoken of in it as a chattel but as a person, and that
those provisions in the constitution which confer certain
privileges on slaveholders were supposed to be
temporary compromises with what the founders of the
constitution imagined would prove only a temporary
institution&mdash;soon to pass entirely away from the country.
He asserts in this speech:</p>

<p>"There is in the constitution no compromise on the
subject of slavery of a character not to be reached
legally and constitutionally, which is the only way in
which I propose to reach it. Wherever power and
jurisdiction are secured to Congress, they may unquestionably
be exercised in conformity with the constitution.
And even in matters beyond existing powers
and jurisdiction there is a constitutional mode of action.
The constitution contains an article pointing out
how at any time amendments may be made thereto.
This is an important article, giving to the constitution
a progressive character, and allowing it to be moulded
to suit new exigences and new conditions of feeling.
The wise framers of this instrument did not treat the
country as a Chinese foot, never to grow after its infancy,
but anticipated the changes incident to its
growth."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Sumner proposed to the Whig party,
as a rallying watch-word, the</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Repeal of slavery under the constitution and
laws of the Federal Government.</span></p>

<p>Of this course he said: "The time has passed when
this can be opposed on constitutional grounds. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
will not be questioned by any competent authority,
that Congress may by express legislation abolish slavery,
1st, in the District of Columbia; 2d, in the Territories,
if there should be any; 3d, that it may abolish
the slave-trade on the high seas between the states;
4th, that it may refuse to admit any new state with a
constitution sanctioning slavery. Nor can it be doubted
that the people of the free States may in the manner
pointed out by the constitution, proceed to its
amendment."</p>

<p>Here we have, in a few words, the platform of the
Political Abolitionists, every step of which has actually
been accomplished.</p>

<p>But at that time it was altogether too exalted doctrine
to be received by the Whig party, and Sumner
tried his eloquence upon them in vain. In vain he
called upon Daniel Webster to carry out this glorious
programme in his place in the Senate.</p>

<p>"Assume," he says, "these unperformed duties.
The aged shall bear witness of you; the young shall
kindle with rapture as they repeat the name of Webster;
and the large company of the ransomed shall
teach their children and their children's children to
the latest generation, to call you blessed; while all
shall award you another title, not to be forgotten in
earth or heaven&mdash;<i>Defender of Humanity</i>."</p>

<p>But Webster had other aspirations. He wanted to
be president of the United States, to be that he must
please the South, and so instead of Defender of Humanity
he turned to be a defender of kidnapping and
of the fugitive slave law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
In 1846, Sumner, in a public letter, rebuked Robert
C. Winthrop, then a Massachusetts representative, for
voting for the Mexican war. In this letter he characterizes
the Mexican war as an unjust attack on a sister
republic, having its origin in a system of measures to
extend slavery; as being dishonorable and cowardly,
as being the attack of a rich and powerful country on
a weak and defenceless neighbor; and having thus
characterized it, he adds:</p>

<p>"Such, sir, is the act of Congress to which, by your
affirmative vote, the people of Boston have been made
parties. Through you they have been made to declare
an unjust and cowardly war, with falsehood, in
the cause of slavery. Through you they have been
made partakers in the blockade of Vera Cruz, in the
seizure of California, in the capture of Santa Fe, and
in the bloodshed of Monterey. It were idle to suppose
that the poor soldier or officer alone is stained
by this guilt&mdash;it reaches back and incarnadines the
halls of Congress; nay, more, through you it reddens
the hands of your constituents in Boston.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"Let me ask you, sir, to remember in your public
course the rules of right which you obey in your private
capacity. The principles of morals are the same
for nations as for individuals. Pardon me if I suggest
that you do not appear to have acted invariably in
accordance with this truth.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"It has been said in apology by your defenders that
the majority of the Whig party joined with you. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
In the question of right and wrong it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
be of little importance that a few fallible men, constituting
what is called a majority, were all of one mind.
But these majorities do not make us withhold our condemnation
from the partakers in those acts. Aloft on
the throne of God, and not below in the footsteps of
the trampling multitude of men, are to be found the
sacred rules of right which no majorities can displace
or overturn. And the question returns, <span class="smcap">Was it right</span>
<i>to vote for an unjust and cowardly war, with falsehood,
for slavery</i>?"</p>

<p>These extracts will give a tolerable certainty that
the old Whig party of Massachusetts, which was thoroughly
dead in the trespasses and sins of pro-slavery
compromise, found Charles Sumner, with all his learning,
and vigor and talent, a rather uncomfortable
member, and that he soon found that the Whig party
was no place for him.</p>

<p>In 1848 he left them to unite in forming the Free
Soil party, in which the platform of principles he had
already announced, was to form the distinctive basis.</p>

<p>And now came the great battle of the Fugitive
Slave Law. The sorceress slavery meditated a grand
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d' etat</i> that should found a Southern slave empire,
and shake off the troublesome North, and to that
intent her agents concocted a statute so insulting to
Northern honor, so needlessly offensive in its provisions,
so derisive of what were understood to be its
religious convictions and humane sentiments, that it
was thought verily, "The North never will submit to
this, and we shall make here the breaking point."
Then arose Daniel Webster, that lost Archangel of
New England&mdash;he who had won her confidence by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
knowledge of and reverence for all that was most sacred
in her, and moved over to the side of evil! It
was as if a great constellation had changed sides in
the heavens, drawing after it a third part of the stars.
The North, perplexed, silenced, troubled, yielded for
a moment. For a brief space all seemed to go down
before that mighty influence, and all listened, as if
spell bound, to the serpent voice with which he scoffed
at the idea that there was a law of God higher than
any law or constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>But that moment of degradation was the last. Back
came the healthy blood, the re-awakened pulse of
moral feeling in New England, and there were found
voices on all sides to speak for the right, and hearts
to respond, and on this tide of re-awakened moral
feeling, Sumner was carried into the United States
Senate, to take the seat vacated by Webster. The
right was not yet victorious, but the battle had turned
so far that its champion had a place to stand on in the
midst of the fray.</p>

<p>And what a battle was that! What an ordeal!
What a gauntlet to run was that of the man in Washington
who in those days set himself against the will
of the great sorceress! Plied with temptation on the
right hand and on the left, studied, mapped out like a
fortress to be attacked and taken, was every Northern
man who entered the arena. Could he be bought,
bribed, cajoled, flattered, terrified? Which, or all?
So planned the conspirators in their secret conclaves.</p>

<p>The gigantic Giddings&mdash;he who brought to the
strife nerves toughened by backwoods toil, and frontier
fights with Indians&mdash;once said of this warfare:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
"I've seen hard fighting with clubs and bullets; I've
seen men falling all around me; but I tell you it takes
more courage to stand up in one's seat in Congress
and say the right thing, than to walk up to the cannon's
mouth. There's no such courage as that of the
anti-slavery men there."</p>

<p>Now, Sumner's superb vitality, that hardy yeoman
blood which his ancestors brought from England, stood
him in excellent stead. His strong and active brain was
based on a body muscular, vigorous, and healthy, incapable
of nervous tremor, bearing him with a steady <i>aplomb</i>
through much that would be confusing and weakening
to men of less physical force. Sumner had not the
character of a ready debater; not a light-armed skirmisher
was he; he resembled rather one of the mailed
warriors of ancient tourney. When he had deliberately
put on his armor, all polished and finished down
to buckle and shoe-latchet, and engraved with what-not
of classic, or Venetian, or Genoese device; when he
put down his visor, steadied his lance, took sure aim,
and went man and horse against his antagonist, all
went down before him, as went down all before the
lance of Cœur-de-Lion.</p>

<p>Such a charge into the enemy was his first great
speech, "Freedom National, Slavery Sectional," which
he directed against the Fugitive Slave Law. It was
a perfect land-slide of history and argument; an avalanche
under which the opposing party were logically
buried, and it has been a magazine from which catapults
have been taken to beat down their fortresses
ever since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
If Daniel Webster merited the title of the great
expounder of the constitution, Sumner at this crisis
merited that of the great defender of the constitution.
In this speech we see clearly the principle on which
Charles Sumner, while holding the same conscientious
ground with Mr. Garrison in regard to the wickedness
of slavery, could yet see his way clear to take the oath
to support and defend the constitution of the United
States.</p>

<p>It was because he believed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex animo</i>, that that
constitution was an agreement made <span class="smcap smaller">TO PROMOTE AND
DEFEND LIBERTY</span>, and though including in itself certain
defective compromises, which never ought to have
been there, had yet within itself the constitutional
power of revoking even those compromises, and coming
over entirely on to the ground of liberty.</p>

<p>The fugitive slave law, as it was called, he opposed
on the ground that it was unconstitutional, that it was
contrary to the spirit and intention of the constitution,
and to the well known spirit and intention of the men
who made that constitution. In this part, Mr. Sumner,
going back to the history of the debates at the formation
of the constitution, gave a masterly <i>resumé</i> of
the subject, showed that the leading men of those
days were all strong anti-slavery men, that they all
looked forward to the gradual dying out of slavery
as certain, and that with great care they avoided in
the constitution any legal recognition of such an unlawful,
unnatural relation. That the word slave did
not exist in the document, and that when the slaves
of the South were spoken of in relation to apportioning
the suffrage, they were spoken of as "persons,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
and not as chattels; that even the very clause of the
constitution which has been perverted into a foundation
for the fugitive slave law, had been purposely so
framed that it did not really describe the position of
slaves under southern law, but only that of such laborers
as were by law denominated and recognized as
<i>persons</i>. By slave law the slaves were not regarded
as "persons held to service and labor," but as chattels
personal, and it was only apprentices and free <i>persons</i>
to whom the terms could literally be made to apply.</p>

<p>He showed by abundant quotations from the debates
of the times that this use of language was not accidental,
but expressly designed to avoid corrupting the
constitution of the United States with any recognition
of the principle that man could hold <i>man</i> as <i>property</i>.
He admitted that the makers of it knew and admitted
that under it slaveholders could recover their slaves,
but considering slaveholding as a temporary thing,
they had arranged so that the language of their great
national document should remain intact and uncorrupt.
From this masterly speech we extract the concluding
summary:</p>

<p>"At the risk of repetition, but for the sake of clearness,
review now this argument, and gather it together.
Considering that slavery is of such an offensive
character that it can find sanction only in positive law
and that it has no such 'positive' sanction in the constitution;
that the constitution, according to its Preamble,
was ordained to 'establish justice,' and 'secure
the blessings of liberty;' that in the convention which
framed it, and also elsewhere at the time, it was declared
not to 'sanction slavery;' that according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Declaration of Independence, and the address of the
Continental Congress, the nation was dedicated to
'liberty' and the 'rights of human nature;' that according
to the principles of common law, the constitution
must be interpreted openly, actively, and perpetually
for Freedom; that according to the decision
of the Supreme Court, it acts upon slaves, <i>not as property</i>,
but as <i>persons</i>; that, at the first organization of
the national government, under Washington, slavery
had no national favor, existed nowhere on the national
territory, beneath the national flag, but was openly
condemned by the nation, the church, the colleges
and literature of the time; and finally, that according
to an amendment of the constitution, the national
government can only exercise powers delegated to it,
among which there is none to support slavery; considering
these things, sir, it is impossible to avoid the
single conclusion that slavery is in no respect a national
institution, and that the constitution nowhere
upholds property in man.</p>

<p>"But there is one other special provision of the constitution,
which I have reserved to this stage, not so
much from its superior importance, but because it may
fitly stand by itself. This alone, if practically applied,
would carry freedom to all within its influence. It is
an amendment proposed by the first Congress, as follows:
'No <i>person</i> shall be deprived of life, <i>liberty</i>, or
property, <i>without due process of law</i>.' Under this
ægis the liberty of every person within the national
jurisdiction is unequivocally placed. I say every person.
Of this there can be no question. The word
'person,' in the constitution, embraces every human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
being within its sphere, whether Caucasian, Indian,
or African, from the President to the slave."</p>

<p>The moral influence of these doctrines on the political
abolitionists was very great. Garrison's sharp, clear
preaching of the Bible doctrine of sin and repentance,
had awakened a great deal of moral feeling in the
land, and it became a real case of conscience to a
great many, how they could in any way take the oath
to support a constitution which they thought supported
slavery. On this subject, in all pure and noble
minds, there began to be great searchings of heart,
but the clearness, the fulness, the triumphant power with
which Sumner and others brought out the true intention
of the constitution, and the spirit of its makers, gave a
feeling of clean and healthy vigor through the whole
party. Even the Garrisonians could perceive at any
rate, that here was a ground where honest Christians
might plant their feet, and get a place in the government
to fight on, until by the constitutional power of
<i>amendment</i> they might some day cast out wholly the
usurping devil of slavery, which had lived and thriven
so much beyond the expectations of our fathers.</p>

<p>Sumner's mind is particularly remarkable for a nice
sense of moral honor. He had truly that which Burke
calls "that chastity of honor which felt a stain like a
wound," and he felt keenly the disgrace and shame of
such an enactment as the fugitive slave law. He
never spoke of it as a law. He was careful to call it
only an <i>enactment</i>, an attempt at law, which being
contrary to the constitution of the country, never
could have the binding force of a law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Next in the political world came the defeat, disgrace,
fall and broken hearted death of Webster,
who, having bid for the Presidency, at the price
of all his former convictions, and in the face of
his former most solemnly expressed opinions, was treated
by the haughty Southern oligarchy with contemptuous
neglect. "The South never pay their slaves,"
said a northern farmer when he heard that Webster
had lost the nomination. Webster felt with keen
pangs, that for that slippery ungrateful South, he had
lost the true and noble heart of the North. In the
grave with Webster died the old Whig party.</p>

<p>But still, though this and that man died, and parties
changed, the unflinching Southern power pushed on
its charge. Webster being done with, it took up
Douglas as its next tool, and by him brought on the
repeal of the Missouri compromise and the Kansas and
Nebraska battle. The war raged fiercer and hotter
and in the fray, Sumner's voice was often heard crying
the war cry of liberty.</p>

<p>And now the war raged deadlier, as came on the
struggle for the repeal of the Missouri compromise,
when the strokes of Sumner's battle axe, long and
heavy, were heard above the din, and always with
crushing execution. The speech on "The Crime
against Kansas," wrought the furnace of wrath to a
white heat. What was to be done with this man?
Call him out and fight him? He was known to be on
principle a non-resistant. Answer him? Indeed! who
ever heard of such a proceeding? How could they?
Had he not spoken the truth? What shall we do then?
Plantation manners suggested an answer. "Come behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
him at an unguarded moment, take him at a disadvantage,
three to one, knock him down and kill
him."</p>

<p>So said&mdash;and but for his strong frame, wonderful in
its recuperative power, and but for the unseen protection
of a higher power,&mdash;it would have been so done.</p>

<p>Everybody knows the brutal history of that coarse
and cowardly assault, and how the poor bully who accomplished
it was <i>fêted</i> and caressed by Southern men
and women in high places, who hastened by presents
of canes, and snuff boxes, and plate, to show forth
how well he had expressed the Southern idea of chivalry.</p>

<p>Three or four years spent abroad, under medical
treatment, were necessary to enable even Sumner's
vigorous vitality to recover from an assault so deadly;
but at last he came back to take his seat in the Senate.</p>

<p>The poor cowardly bully who had assailed him, was
dead&mdash;gone to a higher judgment seat; Butler was
dead&mdash;and other accomplices of the foul deed were
gone also. Under all these circumstances there is something
thrilling in the idea of Sumner rising in the very
seat where he had been stricken down, and pronouncing
that searching speech to which his very presence
there gave such force, "The Barbarism of Slavery."</p>

<p>If he had wished revenge he might have had it, in
the fact that he had the solemn right, as one raised
from the dead, to stand there and give in his awful testimony.
How solemn and dignified, in view of all
these circumstances, seem the introductory words of
his speech:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
"Mr. President, undertaking now, after a silence of
more than four years, to address the Senate on this important
subject, I should suppress the emotions natural
to such an occasion, if I did not declare on the
threshold my gratitude to that Supreme Being, through
whose benign care I am enabled, after much suffering
and many changes, once again to resume my duties
here, and to speak for the cause which is so near my
heart, to the honored commonwealth whose representative
I am, and also to my immediate associates in
this body, with whom I enjoy the fellowship which is
found <i>in thinking alike concerning the Republic</i>. I owe
thanks which I seize this moment to express for the
indulgence shown me throughout the protracted seclusion
enjoined by medical skill; and I trust that it will
not be thought unbecoming in me to put on record
here, as an apology for leaving my seat so long vacant,
without making way, by resignation for a successor,
that I acted under the illusion of an invalid, whose
hopes for restoration to his natural health constantly
triumphed over his disappointments.</p>

<p>"When last I entered into this debate it became my
duty to expose the crime against Kansas, and to insist
upon the immediate admission of that Territory as a
State of this Union, with a constitution forbidding slavery.
Time has passed, but the question remains. Resuming
the discussion precisely where I left it, I am
happy to avow that rule of moderation which, it is
said, may venture even to fix the boundaries of wisdom
itself. I have no personal griefs to utter; only a
barbarous egotism could intrude these into this chamber.
I have no personal wrongs to avenge; only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
barbarous nature could attempt to wield that vengeance
which belongs to the Lord. The years that have intervened,
and the tombs that have been opened since
I spoke, have their voices too, which I cannot fail to
hear. Besides, what am I&mdash;what is any man among
the living or among the dead, compared with the
Question before us? It is this alone which I shall discuss,
and I open the argument with that easy victory
which is found in charity."</p>

<p>Though Sumner was thus moderate in allusion to
himself or others, it was still the constant suggestion
to the minds of all, of the perfect reason <i>he</i>, of
all men, had, to know the truth of what he spoke, that
gave a vehement force to his words. That was a speech
unanswerable, unanswered. The South had tried the
argument of force, and it had failed! There he was
again!&mdash;their accuser at the bar of the civilized world!</p>

<p>In the present administration, as Chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, Sumner has with his
usual learning and power defended American honor
against the causeless defamations and sneers of those
who should have known better. None of our public
men, perhaps, is more favorably known in the Old
World. His talents and accomplishments, as well as
his heroic stand for principle, have given him the familiar
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entrée</i> to all that is best worth knowing in England;
and it is for that reason more admirable that he
should, with such wealth of learning and elegance of
diction, have remonstrated with that great nation on
her injustice to us. His pamphlet on "Our Foreign
Relations" carries a weight of metal in it that is overpowering;
it is as thoroughly exhaustive of the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
as any of his greatest speeches,&mdash;grave, grand, and severely
true. It is the strong blood of England herself
speaking back to the parent land as sorrowfully
as Hamlet to his mother.</p>

<p>In the recent debates on Reconstruction, Sumner has
remained true to that "chastity of honor" in relation
to the United States Constitution, which has been characteristic
of him, in opposing that short sighted republican
policy which proposed to secure the political
privileges of the blacks by introducing the constitutional
amendment, providing that any state disfranchising
negroes should be deprived of a corresponding
portion of its representation in Congress.</p>

<p>Sumner indignantly repelled the suggestion of introducing
any such amendments into the constitution,
as working dishonor to that instrument by admitting
into it, in any form, or under whatsoever pretext, the
doctrine of the political inequality of races of men.
In this we recognize a faultless consistency of principle.</p>

<p>Sumner was cheered in the choice which he made
in the darkest hour, by that elastic hope in the success
of the right, which is the best inheritance of a strong,
and healthy physical and moral organization. During
the time of the Fugitive Slave Law battle, while the conflict
of his election was yet uncertain, he was speaking
incidentally to a friend of the tremendous influences
which the then regnant genius of Daniel Webster could
bring to crush any young man who opposed him. He
spoke with feeling of what had to be sacrificed by a
Boston young man who set himself to oppose such influences.
The friend, in reply, expressed some admiration
of his courage and self-sacrificing. He stopped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
as he was walking up and down the room, and said,
with simplicity, "Courage! No, it doesn't require so
very much courage, because I know that in a few years
we shall have all this thing down under our feet. We
shall set our heel upon it," and he emphasized the sentence
by bringing his heel heavily down upon the carpet.</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?"</p>

<p>"I know so; of course we shall."</p>

<p>Those words, spoken in the darkest hour of the anti-slavery
conflict, have often seemed like a prophecy, in
view of all the fast rushing events of the years that
followed. Now they are verified. Where is the man
who counselled the North to conquer their prejudices?
Where is the man who raised a laugh in popular assemblies
at the expense of those who believed the law
of God to be higher than the law of men? There is a
most striking lesson to young men in these histories.</p>

<p>The grave of the brilliant and accomplished Douglas
lay far back on the road by which Lincoln rose to
fame and honor, and the grave of Webster on that of
Charles Sumner, and on both of those graves might be
inscribed "Lo, this is the man that made not God his
trust." Both scoffed at God's law, and proclaimed
the doctrine of expediency as above right, and both
died broken down and disappointed; while living
and honored at this day, in this land and all lands, are
the names of those, who in its darkest and weakest
hour, espoused the cause of Liberty and Justice.</p>

<p>When a future generation shall be building the
tombs of our present prophets, and adorning the halls
of the Capitol with the busts of men now too hard at
work to be sitting to the sculptor, then there will be
among the marble throng one head not inferior to any
now there in outside marks of greatness&mdash;a head to
which our children shall point and say, "There is the
financier who carried our country through the great
slavery war!"</p>

<p>Not a small thing that to say of any man; for this
war has been on a scale of magnitude before unheard
of in the history of wars. It has been, so to speak, a
fabulous war, a war of a tropical growth, a war to
other wars, like the great Californian pine to the
bramble of the forest. A thousand miles of frontier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
to be guarded, fleets to be created, an army to be organized
and constantly renewed on a scale of numbers
beyond all European experience&mdash;an army, too, for
the most part, of volunteer citizens accustomed to generous
diet, whose camp fare has been kept at a mark
not inferior to the average of living among citizens at
home. And all this was to be effected in no common
times. It was to be done amid the revolutions of business,
the disturbances of trade and manufacture, then
turning into new courses; and above all, the breaking
up of the whole system of cotton agriculture, by
which the greatest staple of the world was produced.
These changes convulsed and disarranged financial
relations in all other countries, and shook the civilized
world like an earthquake.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that a merely insular
paper, like the London <i>Times</i>, ignorant of all beyond
the routine of British and continental probabilities,
should have declared us madmen, and announced our
speedy bankruptcy. We all know that paper to be
conducted by the best of old world ability, and are
ready to concede that the grave writers therein used
their best light, and certainly they did their best to
instruct us. How paternally did it warn us that we
must not look to John Bull for funds to carry out such
extravagances! How ostentatiously did the old banking
houses stand buttoning their pockets, saying,
"Don't come to <i>us</i> to borrow money!" and how did
the wonder grow when the sun rose and set, and still
new levies, new fleets, new armies!&mdash;when hundreds of
thousands grew to millions, and still there was no call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
for foreign money, and government stocks stood in the
market above all others in stability.</p>

<p>One thing, at least, became plain; that whatever might
be the case with the army, <i>financially</i> the American people
had a leader who united them to a man, and under
whose guidance the vast material resources of the
country moved in solid phalanx to support its needs.</p>

<p>When a blade does good service, nothing is more
natural than to turn and read upon it the stamp that
tells where and by whom it was fashioned; and so
when we see the quiet and serenity in which our
country moved on under its burdens, we ask, Whence
comes this man who has carried us so smoothly in such
a storm?</p>

<p>America is before all other things an agricultural
country, and her aristocracy, whether of talent or
wealth, generally trace back their origin to a farm.
The case of Secretary Chase is no exception.</p>

<p>It is one of the traditions of Dartmouth College
that old President Wheelock, in one of his peregrinations,
once stopped in the town of Cornish, N.&nbsp;H.; a
place where the Connecticut river flows out from the
embrace of the White Mountains. Here he passed a
night at a farm-house, the dwelling of Samuel Chase,
a patriarchal farmer, surrounded by seven sons, as
fine, strong and intelligent as those of Jesse of Old
Testament renown. The President used his visit to
plead the cause of a college education for these fine
youths to such good purpose, that five of the boys,
to wit: Salmon, Baruch, Heber, Dudley and Philander
became graduates of Dartmouth College. Two remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
to share the labors of the farm, one of whom
was the father of Secretary Chase.</p>

<p>All the boys thus educated attained more than the
average mark in society, and some to the highest distinction.
Dudley Chase was one of the most distinguished
lawyers and politicians of New England&mdash;a
member of the United States Senate, and for many
years Chief Justice of Vermont. It is said that he
was so enthusiastic a classical scholar that he carried a
Greek Homer and Demosthenes always in his pocket,
for his recreation in intervals of public business. He
lived to a patriarchal age, an object of universal veneration.</p>

<p>Salmon Chase, another brother, was a lawyer in
Portland, the acknowledged leader of that distinguished
bar. He died suddenly, while pleading in
court, in 1806, and in memorial of him our Secretary
received the name of Salmon Portland, at his birth,
which occurred in 1808. The youngest of the graduates,
Philander Chase, was the well-known Episcopal
Bishop of Ohio and Illinois. He was the guardian
under whose auspices the education of Salmon P.
Chase was conducted.</p>

<p>In regard to Chase's early education, we have not
many traditions. His parents were of the best class
of New Hampshire farmers; Bible-reading, thoughtful,
shrewd, closely and wisely economical. It is said
that in that region literary material was so scarce that
the boy's first writing lessons were taken on strips of
birch bark.</p>

<p>When his father died, there was found to be little
property for the support of the family, and only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
small separate estate of his mother was left. She was
of Scotch blood&mdash;that blood which is at once shrewd,
pious, courageous and energetic, and was competent
to make a little serve the uses of a great deal.</p>

<p>But an education, and a college education, is the
goal towards which such mothers in New England set
their faces as a flint&mdash;and by infinite savings and unknown
economies they compass it.</p>

<p>When Chase was fourteen years old, his uncle, the
Bishop, offered to take and educate him, and he went
to Ohio along with an elder brother who was attached
to Gen. Cass's expedition to the upper waters of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>While at Buffalo the seniors of the party made an
excursion to Niagara, but had no room in their vehicle
for the boy. Young Chase, upon this, with characteristic
energy, picked up another boy who wanted to
see the falls, and the two enterprising young gentlemen
footed it through the snow for twenty miles, and
saw the falls in company with their elders.</p>

<p>He remained two years with the Bishop, who was a
peremptory man, and used his nephew as he did himself
and everybody else about him, that is, made him
work just as hard as he could.</p>

<p>The great missionary Bishop had so much to do,
and so little to do it with, that he had to make up for
lack of money by incessant and severe labor, and with
such help as he could get. His nephew being his
own flesh and blood, he felt perhaps at liberty to drive
a little more sharply than the rest, as that is the form
in which the family instinct shows itself in people of
his character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
The Bishop supplemented his own scanty salary by
teaching school and working a farm, and so Salmon's
preparatory studies were seasoned with an abundance
of severe labor.</p>

<p>The youth was near sighted, and troubled with an
obstinate lisp. The former disability was incurable,
but the latter he overcame by means of a long and
persevering course of reading aloud.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Bishop seems to have thought
well of his nephew, for one day in refusing him leave
to go in swimming, he did so with the complimentary
exclamation, "Why, Salmon, the country might lose
its future President, were I to let you get drowned."</p>

<p>After being fitted under his uncle, Chase entered
Dartmouth College.</p>

<p>One anecdote of Chase's college life is characteristic,
as showing that courageous and steady sense of
justice which formed a leading feature of his after life.
One of his classmates was sentenced by the faculty to
be expelled from college on a charge of which Chase
knew him to be wholly innocent. Chase, after in vain
arguing the case with the president, finally told him
that he would go too, as he would not stay in an institution
where his friends were treated with such injustice.
The two youths packed up their goods and drove off.
But the faculty sent word after them almost before
they had got out of the village, that the sentence was
rescinded and they might come back. They said,
however, that they must take time to consider whether
they would do so, and they took a week, having a
pleasant vacation, after which they returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
After graduating, Mr. Chase found himself dependent
on his own exertions to procure his support in his
law studies. He went to Washington intending to
open a private school. He waited in vain for scholars
till his money was gone, and then, feeling discouraged,
asked his uncle the Senator to get him an office under
government.</p>

<p>The old gentleman, who seems to have been about
as stern in his manner of expressing family affection
as his brother the Bishop, promptly refused:</p>

<p>"I'll give you half a dollar to buy you a spade to begin
with," he said, "for then you might come to something
at last, but once settle a young man down in a
government office, he never does any thing more&mdash;it's
the last you hear of him. I've ruined one or two
young men in that way, and I'm not going to ruin you."</p>

<p>Thus with stern kindness was Chase turned off from
what might have made a contented common-place man
of him, and pricked up to the career which gave us a
Secretary of the Treasury and a Chief Justice of the
United States. He succeeded at last in obtaining the
ownership of a select classical school already established,
while he pursued his legal studies under the
auspices of Wirt.</p>

<p>In 1830 he was examined for admission to the bar.
At the close of the examination he was told that he
had better read for another year. He replied that he
could not do that, as he was all ready to commence
practice in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>"Oh, at Cincinnati!" replied the Judge, as if any
law or no law was enough for such a backwoods settlement&mdash;"well
then, Mr. Clerk, swear in Mr. Chase."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
His early days of legal practice, like those of most
young lawyers, were days of waiting and poverty.
The only professional work he did for a considerable
time was to draw an agreement for a man, who paid
him half a dollar, and a week afterwards came and borrowed
it back. In one of his early cases he had occasion
to prove the bad character of a witness who was
on the other side, on which the fellow, who was a well
known rough, threatened to "have his blood," and
undertook to assault him. But as the rowdy came up
at the close of the court, he met so quiet and stern
a look from Mr. Chase's eyes that he turned and
sneaked off without opening his mouth or raising his
hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase's first argument before a United States
Court was at Columbus, O., in 1834. The case was to
him a very important one, and when he arose to make
his argument he found himself so agitated that he
could not utter a word. He had therefore to sit down,
and after waiting a few moments, tried again, and
made his plea. After he was through, one of the
Judges came to him and shook hands with him, saying,
"I congratulate you most sincerely." Chase, who
was feeling very disagreeably, inquired with surprise
what he was congratulated for?</p>

<p>"On your failure," answered the judge, who added,
"A person of ordinary temperament and abilities
would have gone through his part without any such
symptoms of nervousness. But when I see a young
man break down once or twice in that way, I conceive
the highest hopes of him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
This may have been interpreted as a good natured
attempt on the part of the Judge to reassure the young
lawyer, but there is a deep and just philosophy in it.
The class of men who have what Carlye calls "a composed
stupidity, or a cheerful infinitude of ignorance,"
are not liable ever to break down through a
high sense of the magnitude of their task, and the importance
of a crisis. Such as their work is, they are
always in a prepared frame of mind to do it.</p>

<p>Although the Washington judge who passed Mr.
Chase into the legal profession had so small an opinion
of Cincinnati, yet no place could have afforded a finer
and more agreeable position to a rising young man, than
that city in those days. A newly settled place, having
yet lingering about it some of the wholesome neighborly
spirit of a recent colony&mdash;with an eclectic society drawn
from the finest and best cultivated classes of each of
the older States, there was in the general tone of life
a breadth of ideas, a liberality and freedom, which
came from the consorting together of persons of different
habits of living.</p>

<p>In no city was real intellectual or moral worth in a
young candidate likely to meet a quicker and a more
appreciative patronage.</p>

<p>Gradually Mr. Chase gained the familiar <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entrée</i> of all
that was worth knowing, and was received with hospitable
openness in the best society. His fine person,
his vigorous, energetic appearance, and the record of
talent and scholarship he brought with him, secured
him, in time the patronage of the best families, and a
valuable and extensive practice. His industry was incessant,
and his capability of sustained labor uncommon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
as may be gathered from the fact that besides the
labors of his office, he found time to prepare an edition
of the Statutes of Ohio, with notes, and a history
of the State, which is now a standard authority in the
Ohio courts.</p>

<p>In the outset of Chase's career, he, like Charles Sumner,
and every rising young American of his time, met
the great test question of the age. To Chase it came
in the form of an application to plead the cause of a
poor black woman, claimed as a fugitive slave. For a
rising young lawyer to take in hand the cause of a poor
black, now, would be only a road to popularity and
fame. But then the case was far otherwise.</p>

<p>If the abolition excitement had stirred up Boston it
had convulsed Cincinnati. A city separated from slave
territory only by a fordable river, was likely to be no
quiet theatre for such discussions. All the horrors, all
the mean frauds and shocking cruelties of the interstate
slave-trade, were enacting daily on the steamboats
which passed before the city on the Ohio River, and
the chained gangs of broken-hearted human beings,
torn from home and family, to be shipped to Southern
plantations, were often to be seen on steamboats lying
at the levee.</p>

<p>The chapter in Uncle Tom's Cabin called "Select Incidents
of Lawful Trade" was no fancy painting. It was
an almost literal daguerreotype of scenes which the author
of that book had witnessed in those floating palaces
which plied between Cincinnati and New Orleans, and
where too, above in the cabin, were happy mothers, wives,
husbands, brothers and sisters, rejoicing in secure family
affection, and on the deck below, miserable shattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
fragments of black families, wives torn from husbands,
children without mothers and mothers without
children, with poor dumb anxious faces going they
knew not whither, to that awful "down river"&mdash;whence
could come back letter or tidings never more&mdash;for slavery
took care that slaves should write no letters.</p>

<p>Such scenes as these, almost daily witnessed, gave
the discussion of the great question of slavery a startling
and tangible reality which it never could have
had in Boston. For the credit of human nature we
are happy to state that the Ohio was lined all along its
shores, where it ran between free and slave territory,
with a chain of abolitionist forts, in the shape of societies
prosecuting their object with heroic vigor; and
what made the controversy most peculiarly intense
was the assistance which these abolitionists stood always
ready to give to the escaping fugitive. For a
belt of as much as fifty miles all along the river, the
exertions of the abolitionists made slave property the
most insecure of all kinds of possessions.</p>

<p>The slave power, as we have seen, was no meek
non-resistant, and between it and the abolitionists
there was a hand-to-hand grapple, with a short knife,
and deadly home thrusts. The western man is in all
things outspoken and ardent; and Garrison's logical
deductions as to the true nature of slavery came molten
and red hot, as fired from the guns of western abolitionists.
To do them justice, they were sublimely
and awfully imprudent, heroically regardless of any
considerations but those of abstract truth and justice;
they made no more effort to palliate slavery or conciliate
the slaveholders than the slaveholders made efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
to palliate their doings, or conciliate them. War, war
to the knife, was the word on both sides, the only
difference being that the knife of the abolitionist was
a spiritual one, and the knife of the slaveholders a literal
one.</p>

<p>The Lane Theological Seminary was taken possession
of as an anti-slavery fortification by a class of
about twenty vigorous, radical young men, headed
by that brilliant, eccentric genius, Theodore D.
Weld; who came and stationed themselves there ostensibly
as theological students under Dr. Beecher and
Professor Stowe, <i>really</i> that they might make of the
Seminary an anti-slavery fort.</p>

<p>Now at this time, "good society," so called, as constituted
in Cincinnati, had all that easy, comfortable indifference
to the fortunes and sufferings of people not
so well off as itself, which is characteristic of good society
all the world over. It is so much easier to refine
upon one's own ideal of life, to carpet one's floors, and
list one's doors and windows and keep out the cold,
stormy wind of debate and discussion, than it is to go
out into the highways and hedges and keep company
with the never-ending sins and miseries and misfortunes
and mistakes of poor, heavy-laden humanity,
that good society always has sat as a dead weight on
any rising attempt at reform.</p>

<p>Then again, Cincinnati was herself to a large extent
a slaveholding city. Her property was in slaveholding
states. Negroes were negotiable currency;
they were collateral security on half the contracts
that were at the time being made between the thriving
men of Cincinnati and the planters of the adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
slave states. If the bold doctrine of the abolitionists
was true&mdash;if slavery was <i>stealing</i>, then were
the church members in the fairest Cincinnati churches
<i>thieves</i>&mdash;for in one way or another, they were to a
large extent often the holders of slaves.</p>

<p>The whole secret instinct of Cincinnati, therefore,
was to wish that slavery might in some way be defended,
because Cincinnati stood so connected with it in
the way of trade, that conscientious scruples on this
point were infinitely and intolerably disagreeable.
The whirlwind zeal of the abolitionists, the utter, reckless
abandon and carelessness of forms and fashions
with which they threw themselves into the fight, therefore
furnished to good society a cloak large and long,
for all their own sins of neglect. They did not defend
slavery, of course, these good people&mdash;in fact, they
regarded it as an evil. They were properly and decorously
religious&mdash;good society always is, and so willing
in presbytery and synod to have judiciously
worded resolutions from time to time introduced, regretting
slavery as an evil. The meetings of ecclesiastical
bodies afforded at this time examples of most
dexterous theological hair-splitting on this subject.
Invariably in every one of them, were the abolitionists
forward and fiery, calling slavery by that ugly old
Saxon word, "a sin." Then there were the larger
class of brethren, longing for peace, and hating iniquity,
who had sympathy for the inevitable difficulties
which beset well-meaning Christian slaveholders under
slave laws. Now if these consented to call slavery a
sin, they imposed on themselves the necessity of either
enforcing immediate repentance and change of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
on the sinner, or excluding him from the communion.
So they obstinately intrenched themselves in the declaration
that slavery is&mdash;an <span class="smcap smaller">EVIL</span>.</p>

<p>When a synod had spent all its spare time in discussing
whether slavery ought to be described in a resolution
as an evil or as a moral evil, they thought they
had about done their share of duty on the subject;
meanwhile, between the two, the consciences of those
elders and church members who were holding slaves on
bond and mortgage, or sending down orders to sell up
the hands of plantations as securities for their debts,
had a certain troublous peace.</p>

<p>How lucky it was for these poor tempest-tossed
souls that the abolitionists were so imprudent and hot
headed, that they wore garments of camel's hair, and
were girt about the loins with a leathern girdle, and
did eat locusts and wild honey, being altogether an
unpresentable, shaggy, unkempt, impracticable set of
John the Baptist reformers. Their unchristian spirit
shocked the nerves of good pious people far more
than the tearing up of slave families, or the wholesale
injustice of slavery. "The abolitionists do things in
such bad taste," said good society, "that it really makes
it impossible for us to touch the subject at all, lest we
should become mixed up with them, and responsible
for their proceedings." To become mixed up with and
responsible for the proceedings of slaveholders, slave-traders,
and slave-drivers, who certainly exhibited no
more evidences of good taste in their manner of handling
subjects, did not somehow strike good society at
this time as equally objectionable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
It had got to be a settled and received doctrine that
the impudent abolitionists had created such a state of
irritation in the delicate nerves of the slaveholding
power, that all good Christian people were bound to
unite in a general effort to calm irritation by suppressing
all discussion of the subject.</p>

<p>When, therefore, James G. Birney, a southern abolitionist,
who had earned a right to be heard, by first
setting free his own slaves, came to Cincinnati and set
up an abolition paper, there was a boiling over of
the slaveholding fury. For more than a week Cincinnati
lay helpless in a state of semi-sack and siege, trod
under the heels of a mob led by Kentucky bullies and
slave-traders. They sacked Birney's anti-slavery office,
broke up his printing press and threw the types into
the river, and then proceeded to burn negro houses,
and to beat and maltreat defenceless women and children,
after the manner of such evil beasts generally.</p>

<p>At the time the mob were busy destroying the
printing press, Mr. Chase threw himself in among
them with a view to observe, and if possible to obstruct
their proceedings.</p>

<p>He gathered from their threats while the process of
sacking the office was going on, that their next attack
would be on the life of Mr. Birney. On hearing this,
he hastened before them to Mr. Birney's hotel, and
stood in the door-way to meet them when they came
up.</p>

<p>No test of personal courage or manliness is greater
than thus daring to stand and oppose a mob in the
full flush of lawless triumph. Mr. Chase had a fine
commanding person, and perfect courage and coolness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
and he succeeded in keeping back the mob, by arguing
with them against lawless acts of violence to persons
or property, until Birney had had time to escape.</p>

<p>The upper ten of Cincinnati, when tranquility was
once more restored to that community, were of course
very much shocked and scandalized by the proceedings
of the mob, but continued to assert that all these doings
were the fault of the abolitionists. What could
be expected if they <i>would</i> continue discussions which
made our brethren across the river so uncomfortable?
If nobody would defend the rights of negroes there
would be no more negro mobs, and good society became
increasingly set in the belief that speaking for
the slave in any way whatever was actually to join the
abolitionists, and to become in fact a radical, a disorganizer,
a maker of riots and disturbances.</p>

<p>No young lawyer who acted merely from humane
sentiment, or common good natured sympathy, would
have dared at that time to plead a slave's cause against
a master's claim. Then and always there were a plenty
of people to feel instinctive compassion, and in fact
slily to give a hunted fugitive a lift, if sure not to lose
by it&mdash;but to take up and plead professionally a slave's
cause against a master was a thing which no young
man could do without making up his mind to be counted
as one of the abolitionists, and to take upon his
shoulders the whole responsibility of being identified
with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase was a man particularly alive to the value
of all the things which he put in peril by such a
step. He had a remarkable share of what is called
the "Yankee" nature, which values and appreciates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
material good. He had begun poor, and he knew exactly
what a hard thing poverty was. He had begun
at the bottom of the social ladder, and he knew exactly
how hard it was to climb to a good position. He had
just got such a position, and he truly appreciated it.
His best patrons and warmest friends now, with earnestness
warned him not to listen to the voice of his
feelings, and take that course which would identify
him with the fanatical abolitionists. They told him
that it would be social and political death to him to
take a step in that direction.</p>

<p>For all that, when the case of the slave girl Matilda
was brought to his door he defended it deliberately,
earnestly and with all his might. Of course it was decided
against him, as in those days, such cases were sure
to be.</p>

<p>As Chase left the court room after making his plea
in this case, a man looked after him and said, "There
goes a fine young fellow who has just ruined himself."
Listening, however, to this very speech was a public
man of great ability whose efforts afterwards went a
long way towards making Chase United States Senator;
and to-day we see that same young lawyer on the
bench, Chief Justice of the United States.</p>

<p>The decision of Chase in this matter was not merely
from the temporary impulse of kindly feelings, but
from a deep political insight into the tendencies and
workings of the great slave power. His large, sound,
logical brain saw in the future history of that power
all that it has since brought to light. He saw that
the exorbitant spirit of its exactions was directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
against the liberties of the free States and the principles
on which free government is founded.</p>

<p>The plea of Chase, in this case, was the first legal
break-water in Ohio to the flood of usurpation and dictation
which has characterized the slaveocracy from
its commencement. In this plea he took a ground
then unheard of, to wit: That the phrase in the Constitution
which demanded the giving up of fugitives
to service on demand of masters, did not impose on
the magistrates of the free States the responsibility of
catching and returning slaves. He denied that Congress
had any right to impose any such duties on
State magistrates, or to employ State resources in any
way for this purpose. This principle was afterwards
recognized by the United States in the slave law of
1850, by appointing special United States Commissioners
for the conducting of such cases.</p>

<p>From the time of this plea many of the former patrons
and friends of the rising young lawyer walked
no more with him; but he had taken his ground like
a strong man armed, and felt well able to keep his
fortress single handed till recruits should gather around
him.</p>

<p>He was soon called on to defend James G. Birney
for the crime of sheltering a fugitive slave. In this
plea he asserted the great principle afterwards affirmed
by Charles Sumner in Congress, that slavery is sectional
and freedom national. As slavery was but a
local institution, he claimed that it ceased when the
slave was brought by his master to a free State. This
assertion caused great excitement in a community
separated from a slave State only by the Ohio, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
slave masters were constantly finding it convenient to
cross with their slaves, or to send them across, to the
neighboring city. Of course the decision went against
him. What judge who had any hopes of the presidency,
or the Supreme Bench, would dare offend his
southern masters by any other?</p>

<p>In 1846 came on the great Van Zandt case. Van
Zandt was originally a thriving Kentucky farmer and
slave owner. He figured in Uncle Tom's Cabin under
the name of Van Tromp. He was a man who, under
a shaggy exterior, had a great, kind, honest heart, and
in that day, when ministers and elders were studying
the Bible to find apologies for slavery, Van Zandt
needed no other light than that of this same heart to
teach him that it was vile and devilish, and so, setting
his slaves free, he came over and bought a farm in the
neighborhood of Cincinnati; and it was well known
that no hungry, wandering fugitive was ever turned
from Van Zandt's door. The writer has still memory
of the wild night ride of husband and brother through
woods, and over swelled creeks dangerous enough to
cross, which carried a poor, hunted slave girl to this
safe retreat. But Van Zandt was at last found out,
and the slaveocrats brought suit against him. Chase
and Seward defended him, and made noble pleas&mdash;pleas
as much for the rights of the whites as of the
blacks. Of course, like all cases of the kind at that
date, the judgment had been pre-ordained before the
court sat. Chase's elaborate and unanswerable argument
before the United States Court, was afterward
printed in a pamphlet of some three hundred and fifty
octavo pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
The opening of this great plea and its close we shall
quote as best showing the solemn and earnest spirit
in which this young lawyer entered upon his work.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Chief Justice and Judges</span>:</p>

<p>I beg leave to submit to your consideration an argument
in behalf of an old man, who is charged, under
the act of Congress of February 12, 1793, with having
concealed and harbored a fugitive slave.</p>

<p>Oppressed, and well nigh borne down by the painful
consciousness, that the principles and positions
which it will be my duty to maintain, can derive no
credit whatever from the reputation of the advocate, I
have spared no pains in gathering around them whatever
of authority and argument the most careful research
and the most deliberate reflection could supply. I
have sought instruction wherever I could find it; I
have looked into the reported decisions of almost
all the state courts, and of this court; I have examined
and compared state legislation and federal;
above all, I have consulted the constitution of the
Union, and the history of its formation and adoption.
I have done this, because I am well assured, that the
issues, now presented to this court for solemn adjudication,
reach to whatever is dear in constitutional
liberty, and what is precious in political union. Not
John Van Zandt alone&mdash;not numerous individuals only&mdash;but
the States also, and the Nation itself, must be
deeply affected by the decision to be pronounced in
this case."</p>

<p>Then followed the technical and legal plea which
is a most close and unanswerable legal argument, showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
conclusively that under the words of the statute
the defendant could not be held guilty.</p>

<p>After this, follows a clear and masterly argument on
the unconstitutionality of the then existing fugitive
slave law, of 1793. In this, Chase took with great
skill, boldness, ingenuity and learning, the same
course afterwards taken by Sumner in his great speech
before Congress, on the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.</p>

<p>The conclusion is solemn and weighty&mdash;and in the
light of recent events has even a prophetic power:</p>

<p>"Upon questions,&mdash;such as are some of those involved
in this case,&mdash;which partake largely of a moral and political
nature, the judgment, even of this Court, cannot
be regarded as altogether final. The decision, to
be made here, must, necessarily, be rejudged at the
tribunal of public opinion&mdash;the opinion, not of the
American People only, but of the Civilized World.
At home, as is well known, a growing disaffection to
the Constitution prevails, founded upon its supposed allowance
and support of Human Slavery; abroad, the
national character suffers under the same reproach. I
most earnestly hope, and,&mdash;I trust it may not be
deemed too serious to add,&mdash;I most earnestly pray, that
the judgment of your honors in this case, may commend
itself to the reason and conscience of Mankind;
that it may rescue the Constitution from the undeserved
opprobrium of lending its sanction to the idea that
there may be property in men; that it may gather
around that venerable charter of Republican Government
the renewed affection and confidence of a
generous People; and that it may win for American
Institutions the warm admiration and profound homage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
of all, who, everywhere, love Liberty and revere
Justice."</p>

<p>The question was decided as all such cases in those
times invariably were decided.</p>

<p>The Judge never undertook even the form of answering
the argument; never even adverted to it, but
decided directly over it, with a composure worthy of a
despotism. It was a decision only equalled by that of
the most corrupt judges of the corrupt age of Charles
II.</p>

<p>Honest Van Zandt was ruined, "scot and lot," by a
fine so heavy that all he had in the world would not
pay it, and he died broken-hearted; a solemn warning
to all in his day, how they allowed themselves to
practise Christian charity in a way disagreeable to the
plantation despots.</p>

<p>As for Chase, he was undiscouraged by ill success,
and shortly reaffirmed his argument and principles in
the case of Driskull vs. Parish. He was at least educating
the community; he was laying foundations of
resistance on which walls and towers should by-and-by
arise. Humanity and religion had already made the
abolitionists numerically a large and active body in
Ohio. They needed only a leader like Chase, of large
organizing brain and solid force of combination, to shape
them into a political party of great efficiency. To this
end his efforts were henceforth directed. In 1841, he
united in a call for an Anti-Slavery Convention in Columbus,
and in this convention was organized the Liberty
party of Ohio. In 1845 he projected a Southwestern
Anti-Slavery Convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
The ground taken was substantially that to which a
bloody, weary experience has brought the whole nation
now, to wit: "That whatever is worth preserving
in republicanism can be maintained only by uncompromising
war against an usurping slave-power, and
that all who wish to save the nation must unite in
using all constitutional measures for the extinction of
slavery in their own States, and the reduction of it to
constitutional limits in the United States.</p>

<p>This convention met in Cincinnati, in 1845, and
Chase prepared the address, giving the history of
slavery thus far, and showing the condition of the
Whig and Democratic parties respecting it; and urging
the importance of a political combination unequivocally
committed to the denationalizing of slavery
and the slave power. So vigorous were the tactics of
this party, so strongly moving with the great central
currents of God's forward providences, that in 1847
Chase was made Governor of Ohio, by the triumph of
those very principles which in the outset threatened
utter loss to their advocate. In 1847 he attended a
second Liberty Convention; and afterwards took part
in the Buffalo Convention, the celebrated Buffalo Platform
being mainly his work.</p>

<p>In 1849, he was chosen United States Senator from
Ohio, and his presence was hailed as a tower of strength
to the hard fighting anti-slavery party at Washington.
When, directly after the passage of the Fugitive Slave
Law, the Democratic party in Ohio voted for Pierce,
knowing him directly committed to its enforcement,
Chase withdrew from it, and addressed a letter to B.
F. Butler, of New York, recommending the formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
of an Independent Democratic party. He prepared
a platform for this purpose, which was substantially
adopted by the convention of the Independent Democracy
of 1852.</p>

<p>And now came on the battle of Kansas and Nebraska.
Chase was one of the first to awaken the people
to this new danger. He, in conference with the anti-slavery
men of Congress, drafted an address to the
people to arouse them as to this sudden and appalling
conspiracy, which was intended to seize for slavery all
the unoccupied land of the United States, and turn
the balance of power and numbers forever into the
slaveholders' hands. It was a critical moment; there
was but little time to spare; but the whole united
clergy of New England, of all denominations, Catholic
and Protestant, found leisure to send in their solemn
protest. When that nefarious bill passed, Chase protested
against it on the night of its passage, as, with
threats, and oaths, and curses, it was driven through.
It seems in the retrospect but a brief passage from
that hour of apparent defeat to the hour which beheld
Lincoln in the presidential chair and Chase, Secretary
of the Treasury. His history in that position has verified
the sagacity that placed him there. It has been
the success of a large, sound, organizing brain, apt
and skillful in any direction in which it should turn its
powers. It was the well-known thrift and shrewdness
of the Yankee farmer, thrift and shrewdness cultivated
in years of stern wrestling with life, coming out at the
head of the United States treasury in a most critical
hour. No men are better to steer through exigencies
than these same Yankee farmers, and it seems the savor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
of this faculty goes to the second and third generations.</p>

<p>We have said before, that if Chase made sacrifices
of tangible and material present values for abstract
principles, in his early days, it was not because, as is
sometimes the case, he was a man merely of ideas,
and destitute of practical faculties. On the contrary,
the shrewd, cautious, managing, self-preserving faculties
were possessed by him to a degree which caused
him to be often spoken of by the familiar proverb,
"a man who can make every edge cut." By nature,
by descent, by hard and severe training, he was a
rigid economist, and a man who might always safely
be trusted to make the very most and best of a given
amount of property.</p>

<p>It is praise enough to any financier who could take
a nation in the sudden and unprepared state ours was,
and could carry it along for three or four years through
a war of such gigantic expenditure, to say that the country
was neither ruined, beggared, nor hopelessly embarrassed,
but standing even stronger when he resigned
the treasury than when he took it.</p>

<p>His financial management was at first to raise the
money needed for the war by loans, until the expenses
became so great as to be beyond the capacity of
the specie in the country. Then, still adhering to the
principle of raising the means for the war within the
United States, he introduced the legal tender paper
currency, and by providing that it should be a necessary
basis for banking operations, he shrewdly placed the
whole banking capital of the United States in a position
where it must live or die with the country. This not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
only provided funds, but made every dollar of money
act as a direct stimulus to the patriotism of those who
supplied it.</p>

<p>On June 30, 1864, Chase resigned his position in
the treasury. That Providence which has ordained so
many striking and peculiar instances of victory and
reward for men who espoused the cause of humanity
in its dark hours, had also one for Chase.</p>

<p>Oct. 12, 1864, by the death of Taney, the Chief
Justiceship of the United States Supreme Court became
vacant, and Lincoln expressed the sense of the
whole American people in calling Chase to fill that venerable
office.</p>

<p>The young lawyer, who without name or prestige,
dared to put in pleas for the poorest of his brethren,
when the slave power was highest and haughtiest, and
whose pleas were overruled with the most chilling
contempt, now by God's providence holds that supreme
position on the national bench from which, let
us trust, the oppressor and the tyrant have faded away
forever!</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice how, in the recent struggle
that has convulsed our country and tried our republican
institutions, so many of the men who have
held the working oar have been representative men
of the people. To a great extent they have been
men who have grown up with no other early worldly
advantages than those which a democratic republic
offers to every citizen born upon her soil. Lincoln
from the slave states, and Chase and Henry Wilson in
the free, may be called the peculiar sons of Democracy.
That hard Spartan mother trained them early on
her black broth to her fatigues, and wrestlings, and
watchings, and gave them their shields on entering
the battle of life with only the Spartan mother's brief&mdash;"With
this, or upon this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Native force and Democratic institutions raised Lincoln
to the highest seat in the nation, and to no mean
seat among the nations of the earth; and the same
forces in Massachusetts caused that State, in an hour
of critical battle for the great principles of democratic
liberty, to choose Henry Wilson, the self-taught, fearless
shoemaker's apprentice of Natick, over the head
of the gifted and graceful Everett, the darling of foreign
courts, the representative of all the sentiments and
training which transmitted aristocratic ideas have yet
left in Boston and Cambridge. All this was part and
parcel of the magnificent drama which has been acting
on the stage of this country for the hope and consolation
of all who are born to labor and poverty in all
nations of the world.</p>

<p>Henry Wilson, our present United States Senator,
was born at Farmington, N.&nbsp;H., Feb. 12, 1818, of very
poor parents. At the age of ten he was bound to a
farmer till he was twenty-one. Here he had the usual
lot of a farm boy&mdash;plain, abundant food, coarse clothing,
incessant work, and a few weeks' schooling at the
district school in winter.</p>

<p>In these ten years of toil, the boy, by twilight, firelight,
and on Sundays, had read over one thousand
volumes of history, geography, biography and general
literature, borrowed from the school libraries and
from those of generous individuals.</p>

<p>At twenty-one he was his own master, to begin the
world; and in looking over his inventory for starting
in life, found only a sound and healthy body, and a
mind trained to reflection by solitary thought. He
went to Natick, Mass., to learn the trade of a shoemaker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
and in working at it two years, he saved enough
money to attend the academy at Concord and Wolfsborough,
N.&nbsp;H. But the man with whom he had deposited
his hard earnings became insolvent; the money
he had toiled so long for, vanished; and he was
obliged to leave his studies, go back to Natick and
make more. Undiscouraged, he resolved still to pursue
his object, uniting it with his daily toil. He formed
a debating society among the young mechanics of
the place; investigated subjects, read, wrote and
spoke on all the themes of the day, as the spirit within
him gave him utterance. Among his fellow-mechanics,
some others were enkindled by his influence,
and are now holding high places in the literary and
diplomatic world.</p>

<p>In 1840, young Wilson came forward as a public
speaker. He engaged in the Harrison election campaign,
made sixty speeches in about four months,
and was well repaid by his share in the triumph of
the party. He was then elected to the Massachusetts
Legislature as representative from Natick.</p>

<p>Having entered life on the working man's side, and
known by his own experience the working man's trials,
temptations and hard struggles, he felt the sacredness
of a poor man's labor, and entered public life with a
heart to take the part of the toiling and the oppressed.</p>

<p>Of course he was quick to feel that the great question
of our time was the question of labor and its
rights and rewards. He was quick to feel the "irrepressible
conflict," which Seward so happily designated,
between the two modes of society existing in
America, and to know that they must fight and struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
till one of them throttled and killed the other;
and prompt to understand this, he made his early election
to live or die on the side of the laboring poor,
whose most oppressed type was the African slave.</p>

<p>In the Legislature, he introduced a motion against
the extension of slave territory; and in 1845, went
with Whittier to Washington with the remonstrance
of Massachusetts against the admission of Texas as a
slave State.</p>

<p>When the Whig party became inefficient in the
cause of liberty through too much deference to the
slave power, Henry Wilson, like Charles Sumner, left
it, and became one of the most energetic and efficient
organizers in forming the Free Soil party of Massachusetts.
In its interests, he bought a daily paper in
Boston, which for some time he edited with great
ability.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he rose to one step of honor after
another, in his adopted State; he became President
of the Massachusetts Senate; and at length after a
well contested election, was sent to take the place of
the accomplished Everett in the United States Senate.</p>

<p>His election was a sturdy triumph of principle. His
antagonist had every advantage of birth and breeding,
every grace which early leisure, constant culture, and
the most persevering, conscientious self-education
could afford. He was, in graces of person, manners
and mind, the ideal of Massachusetts aristocracy, but
he wanted that clear insight into actual events, which
early poverty and labor had given to his antagonist.
His sympathies in the great labor question of the land
were with the graceful and cultivated aristocrats rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
than the clumsy, ungainly laborer; and he but professed
the feeling of all aristocrats in saying at the
outset of his political life, while Wilson was yet a child,
that in the event of a servile insurrection, he would
be among the first to shoulder a musket to defend the
masters.</p>

<p>But the great day of the Lord was at hand. The
events which since have unrolled in fire and blood,
had begun their inevitable course; and the plain working-man
was taken by the hand of Providence towards
the high places where he, with other working men,
should shape the destiny of the labor question for this
age and for all ages.</p>

<p>Wilson went to Washington in the very heat and
fervor of that conflict which the gigantic Giddings,
with his great body and unflinching courage, said to a
friend, was to him a severer trial of human nerve than
the facing of cannon and bullets. The slave aristocracy
had come down in great wrath, as if knowing
that its time was short. The Senate chamber rang
with their oaths and curses as they tore and raged like
wild beasts against those whom neither their blandishments
nor their threats could subdue. Wilson brought
there his face of serene good nature, his vigorous,
stocky frame, which had never seen ill-health, and in
which the nerves were yet an undiscovered region.
It was entirely useless to bully, or to threaten, or to
cajole that honest, good-humored, immovable man,
who stood like a rock in their way, and took all their
fury as unconsciously as a rock takes the foam of
breaking waves. In every anti-slavery movement he
was always foremost, perfectly awake, perfectly well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
informed, and with that hardy, practical business
knowledge of men and things which came from his
early education, prepared to work out into actual
forms what Sumner gave out as splendid theories.</p>

<p>Wilson's impression on the Senate was not mainly
that of an orator. His speeches were as free from the
artifices of rhetoric as those of Lincoln, but they were
distinguished for the weight and abundance of the
practical information and good sense which they contained.
He never spoke on a subject till he had made
himself minutely acquainted with it in all its parts,
and was accurately familiar with all that belonged to
it. Not even John Quincy Adams or Charles Sumner
could show a more perfect knowledge of what they
were talking about than Henry Wilson. Whatever
extraneous stores of knowledge and belles lettres may
have been possessed by any of his associates, no man
on the floor of the Senate could know more of the
<i>United States of America</i> than he; and what was
wanting in the graces of the orator, or the refinements
of the rhetorician was more than made amends for in
the steady, irresistible, strong tread of the honest man,
determined to accomplish a worthy purpose.</p>

<p>Wilson succeeded Benton as chairman of the Military
Committee of the Senate, and it was fortunate for
the country that when the sudden storm of the war
broke upon us, so strong a hand held this helm. Gen.
Scott said that he did more work in the first three
months of the war than had been done in his position
before for twenty years; and Secretary Cameron attributed
the salvation of Washington in those early
days, mainly to Henry Wilson's power of doing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
apparently impossible in getting the Northern armies
into the field in time to meet the danger.</p>

<p>His recently published account of what Congress
has done to destroy slavery, is a history which no man
living was better fitted to write. No man could be
more minutely acquainted with the facts, more capable
of tracing effects to causes, and thus competent to
erect this imperishable monument to the honor of his
country.</p>

<p>It is meet that the poor, farm-bound apprentice, the
shoemaker of Natick, should thus chronicle the great
history of the deliverance of labor from disgrace in
this democratic nation.</p>

<p>There is something sublime in the history of the movements
of the 37th and 38th Congresses of the United
States. Perhaps never in any country did an equal
number of wise and just men meet together under a
more religious sense of their responsibility to God and
to mankind. Never had there been a deeper and
more religious awe presiding over popular elections
than those which sent those men to Congress to man
our national ship in the terrors of the most critical
passage our stormy world has ever seen. They were
the old picked, tried seamen, stout of heart, giants in
conscience and moral sense. They were the scarred
veterans of long years of battling for the great principles
of the Declaration of Independence, men who
in old times had come through great battles with the
beasts of the slavery Ephesus, and still wore the scars
of their teeth. They had seen their president stricken
down at their head, and though bleeding inwardly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
had closed up their ranks shoulder to shoulder, to go
steadily on with the great work for which he died.</p>

<p>These men it was who while the din of arms was
resounding through the country, while Washington
was one great camp and hospital, and the confusing
rumors of wars were coming to it from the east and
from the west, from the north and from the south&mdash;took
up and carried to the end the grandest national
moral reform ever accomplished in a given time. Many
men of the common sort would have said, "This is no
time to be driving at moral reforms. We must drive
this war through first, and when we have done this,
we will begin to wipe up, and adjust, and put away."
So gigantic a war was apology enough to satisfy the
consciences of men who looked only to precedents
and the rules of ordinary statesmanship, but our Congress
was largely made up of men who walked by a
higher light, and judged by a higher standard than
ever has been given to mere statesmanship before.
The spirit of the old Puritans, their unworldly, God-fearing
spirit, their steadfast flint-facedness in principle,
came to a final and culminating development in these
Congresses.</p>

<p>Henry Wilson has written a "History of the Anti-Slavery
Measures in Congress," in a brief, clear, compact
summary, and made of it a volume which ought
to be in every true American library. It is a volume
of which every American has just and honest reason
to be proud, and to which every Republican the whole
world over, should look with hope and trust, as exhibiting
the magnificent morality, the dauntless courage,
the unwearied faith, hope and charity that are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
crown jewels of republics. We should be glad to see
this book of Henry Wilson's in every farm house of
New England, lying by the family Bible, under the
old flag of the Union. The men who carried through
these magnificent reforms&mdash;<span class="smcap smaller">THEY ARE OUR JEWELS</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson gives in his book a condensed summary
of the debates in the House relative to each step of
the reform. For the most part it is a record of noble,
Christian, unworldly patriotic sentiment&mdash;a sort of
ideal statesmanship becoming real in tangible good
deeds.</p>

<p>Every day some new den in the Augean stable was
exposed and opened up to daylight, and the cleansing
baptism of liberty applied. There was some fluttering
and screaming of owls and bats, and now and then
the poor old dilapidated dragon of slavery gave a bootless
hiss, but nobody minded it. It was a whole-hearted,
clean, pure, noble time in Congress, when those
walls, so long defiled with the brawls, the mingled profanity
and obscenity of slaveholders and slavebreeders,
now rang only to manly sentiments and cleanly, noble,
Christian resolves, such as make the heart strong to
hear. We quote from the close of Mr. Wilson's book
the summary of what was done by these Congresses in
the way of reform legislation.</p>

<p>"As the Union armies advanced into the rebel States,
slaves, inspired by the hope of personal freedom,
flocked to their encampments, claiming protection
against rebel masters, and offering to work and fight
for the flag whose stars for the first time gleamed upon
their vision with the radiance of liberty. Rebel masters
and rebel-sympathizing masters sought the encampments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
of the loyal forces, demanding the surrender
of the escaped fugitives; and they were often delivered
up by officers of the armies. To weaken the
power of the insurgents, to strengthen the loyal forces,
and assert the claims of humanity, the 37th Congress
enacted an article of war, dismissing from the service
officers guilty of surrendering these fugitives.</p>

<p>Three thousand persons were held as slaves in the
District of Columbia, over which the nation exercised
exclusive jurisdiction; the 37th Congress made these
three thousand bondmen freemen, and made slaveholding
in the capital of the nation for evermore impossible.</p>

<p>"Laws and ordinances existed in the national capital
that pressed with merciless rigor upon the colored people:
the 37th Congress enacted that colored persons
should be tried for the same offences, in the same manner,
and be subject to the same punishments, as white
persons; thus abrogating the 'black code.'</p>

<p>"Colored persons in the capital of this Christian nation
were denied the right to testify in the judicial tribunals;
thus placing their property, their liberties, and
their lives, in the power of unjust and wicked men;
the 37th Congress enacted that persons should not be
excluded as witnesses in the courts of the District on
account of color.</p>

<p>"In the capital of the nation, colored persons were
taxed to support schools from which their own children
were excluded; and no public schools were provided
for the instruction of more than four thousand
youth; the 38th Congress provided by law that public
schools should be established for colored children,
and that the same rate of appropriations for colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
schools should be made as are made for schools for
the education of white children.</p>

<p>"The railways chartered by Congress, excluded from
their cars colored persons, without the authority of
law; Congress enacted that there should be no exclusion
from any car on account of color.</p>

<p>"Into the territories of the United States,&mdash;one-third
of the surface of the country,&mdash;the slaveholding
class claimed the right to take and hold their slaves
under the protection of law; the 37th Congress prohibited
slavery for ever in all the existing territory,
and in all territory which may hereafter be acquired;
thus stamping freedom for all, for ever, upon the public
domain.</p>

<p>"As the war progressed, it became more clearly apparent
that the rebels hoped to win the Border slave
States; that rebel sympathizers in those States hoped
to join the rebel States; and that emancipation in
loyal States would bring repose to them, and weaken
the power of the Rebellion; the 37th Congress, on the
recommendation of the President, by the passage of a
joint resolution, pledged the faith of the nation to aid
loyal States to emancipate the slaves therein.</p>

<p>"The hoe and spade of the rebel slave were hardly
less potent for the Rebellion than the rifle and
bayonet of the rebel soldier. Slaves sowed and reaped
for the rebels, enabling the rebel leaders to fill the
wasting ranks of their armies, and feed them. To
weaken the military forces and the power of the Rebellion,
the 37th Congress decreed that all slaves of
persons giving aid and comfort to the Rebellion, escaping
from such persons, and taking refuge within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
the lines of the army; all slaves captured from such
persons, or deserted by them; all slaves of such persons,
being within any place occupied by rebel forces,
and afterwards occupied by the forces of the United
States,&mdash;shall be captives of war, and shall be for ever
free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves.</p>

<p>"The provisions of the Fugitive-slave Act permitted
disloyal masters to claim, and they did claim, the return
of their fugitive bondmen; the 37th Congress
enacted that no fugitive should be surrendered until
the claimant made oath that he had not given aid and
comfort to the Rebellion.</p>

<p>"The progress of the Rebellion demonstrated its
power, and the needs of the imperilled nation. To
strengthen the physical forces of the United States,
the 37th Congress authorized the President to receive
into the military service persons of African descent;
and every such person mustered into the service, his
mother, his wife and children, owing service or labor
to any person who should give aid and comfort to the
Rebellion, was made for ever free.</p>

<p>"The African slave-trade had been carried on by slave
pirates under the protection of the flag of the United
States. To extirpate from the seas that inhuman
traffic, and to vindicate the sullied honor of the nation,
the Administration early entered into treaty stipulations
with the British Government for the mutual
right of search within certain limits; and the 37th
Congress hastened to enact the appropriate legislation
to carry the treaty into effect.</p>

<p>"The slaveholding class, in the pride of power, persistently
refused to recognize the independence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Hayti and Liberia; thus dealing unjustly towards those
nations, to the detriment of the commercial interests
of the country; the 37th Congress recognized the independence
of those republics by authorizing the President
to establish diplomatic relations with them.</p>

<p>"By the provisions of law, white male citizens alone
were enrolled in the militia. In the amendment to
the acts for calling out the militia, the 37th Congress
provided for the enrollment and drafting of citizens,
without regard to color; and, by the Enrollment Act,
colored persons, free or slave, are enrolled and drafted
the same as white men. The 38th Congress enacted
that colored soldiers shall have the same pay, clothing,
and rations, and be placed in all respects upon
the same footing, as white soldiers. To encourage enlistments,
and to aid emancipation, the 38th Congress
decreed that every slave mustered into the military
service shall be free for ever; thus enabling every
slave fit for military service to secure personal freedom.</p>

<p>"By the provisions of the fugitive-slave acts, slave-masters
could hunt their absconding bondmen, require
the people to aid in their recapture, and have them
returned at the expense of the nation. The 38th Congress
erased all fugitive-slave acts from the statutes of
the Republic.</p>

<p>"The law of 1807 legalized the coastwise slave-trade;
the 38th Congress repealed that act, and made the
trade illegal.</p>

<p>"The courts of the United States receive such testimony
as is permitted in the States where the courts
are holden. Several of the States exclude the testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
of colored persons. The 38th Congress made
it legal for colored persons to testify in all the courts
of the United States.</p>

<p>"Different views are entertained by public men relative
to the reconstruction of the governments of the
seceded States, and the validity of the President's
proclamation of emancipation. The 38th Congress
passed a bill providing for the reconstruction of the
governments of the rebel States, and for the emancipation
of the slaves in those States; but it did not receive
the approval of the President.</p>

<p>"Colored persons were not permitted to carry the
United States mails; the 38th Congress repealed the
prohibitory legislation, and made it lawful for persons
of color to carry the mails.</p>

<p>"Wives and children of colored persons in the military
and naval service of the United States were often
held as slaves; and, while husbands and fathers were
absent fighting the battles of the country, these wives
and children were sometimes removed and sold, and
often treated with cruelty; the 38th Congress made
free the wives and children of all persons engaged in
the military or naval service of the country.</p>

<p>"The disorganization of the slave system, and the exigencies
of civil war, have thrown thousands of freedmen
upon the charity of the nation; to relieve their
immediate needs, and to aid them through the transition
period, the 38th Congress established a Bureau of
Freedmen.</p>

<p>"The prohibition of slavery in the Territories, its abolition
in the District of Columbia, the freedom of colored
soldiers, their wives and children, emancipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
in Maryland, West Virginia, and Missouri, and by the
re-organized State authorities of Virginia, Tennessee,
and Louisiana, and the President's Emancipation Proclamation,
disorganized the slave system, and practically
left few persons in bondage; but slavery still
continued in Delaware and Kentucky, and the slave
codes remain, unrepealed in the rebel States. To annihilate
the slave system, its codes and usages; to
make slavery impossible, and freedom universal,&mdash;the
38th Congress submitted to the people an anti-slavery
amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
The adoption of that crowning measure assures freedom
to all.</p>

<p>"Such are the "<span class="smcap">Anti-slavery Measures</span>" of the
Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth Congresses during
the past four crowded years. Seldom in the history
of nations is it given to any body of legislators or law-givers
to enact or institute a series of measures so vast
in their scope, so comprehensive in their character, so
patriotic, just, and humane.</p>

<p>"But, while the 37th and 38th Congresses were enacting
this anti-slavery legislation, other agencies were
working to the consummation of the same end,&mdash;the
complete and final abolition of slavery. The President
proclaims three and a half millions of bondmen in
the rebel States henceforward and for ever free. Maryland,
Virginia, and Missouri adopt immediate and unconditional
emancipation. The partially re-organized
rebel States of Virginia and Tennessee, Arkansas and
Louisiana, accept and adopt the unrestricted abolition
of slavery. Illinois and other States hasten to blot
from their statute-books their dishonoring black codes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
The Attorney-General officially pronounces the negro
a citizen of the United States. The negro, who had
no status in the Supreme Court, is admitted by the
Chief Justice to practice as an attorney before that
august tribunal. Christian men and women follow
the loyal armies with the agencies of mental and moral
instruction to fit and prepare the enfranchised freedmen
for the duties of the higher condition of life now
opening before them."</p>

<p>We cannot quit this subject without remarking on
the striking character of the debates Mr. Wilson's
book records on these subjects. The great majority
of Congress utters aloud and with one consent, just,
manly, noble, humane, large-hearted sentiments and resolves,
while a poor wailing minority is picking up and
retailing the old worn out jokes and sneers and incivilities
and obscenities of the dying dragon of slavery.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the utter naiveté and ignorance
of comity and good manners induced by slavery, in
contrast with the courtesy and refinement of true republicanism,
we give this fragment of a debate on the
recognition of Hayti and Liberia.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, after plaintively stating
that he is weary, sick, disgusted, despondent with the
introduction of slaves and slavery into this chamber,
proceeds to state his terror lest should these measures
take effect, these black representatives would have to
be received on terms of equality with those of other
nations. Mr. Davis goes on to say: "A big negro fellow,
dressed out in his silver and gold lace, presented
himself in the court of Louis Napoleon, I admit, and
was received. Now, sir, <i>I</i> want no such exhibition as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
that in our country. The American minister, Mr. Mason,
was present on that occasion; and he was sleeved
by some Englishman&mdash;I have forgotten his name&mdash;who
was present, who pointed out to him the ambassador
of Soulouque, and said, 'What do you think of
him?' Mr. Mason turned round and said, 'I think,
clothes and all, he is worth a thousand dollars.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Davis evidently considered this witticism of Mr.
Mason's as both a specimen of high bred taste and a
settling argument.</p>

<p>In reply, Mr. Sumner drily says: "The Senator
alludes to some possible difficulties, I hardly know
how to characterize them, which may occur here in
social life, should the Congress of these United States
undertake at this late day, simply in harmony with the
law of nations, and following the policy of civilized
communities, to pass the bill under discussion. I shall
not follow the senator on those sensitive topics. I
content myself with a single remark. I have more
than once had the opportunity of meeting citizens of
these republics; and I say nothing more than truth
when I add, that I have found them so refined, and so
full of self-respect, that I am led to believe no one of
them charged with a mission from his government, will
seek any society where he will not be entirely welcome.
Sir, the senator from Kentucky may banish
all anxiety on that account. No representative from
Hayti or Liberia will trouble him."</p>

<p>Mr. Crittenden of Kentucky said: "I will only say,
sir, that I have an innate sort of confidence and pride
that the race to which we belong is a superior race
among the races of the earth, and I want to see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
pride maintained. The Romans thought that no people
on the face of the earth were equal to the citizens
of Rome, and it made them the greatest people in the
world. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The spectacle of such a diplomatic
dignitary in our country, would, I apprehend, be offensive
to the people for many reasons, and wound
their habitual sense of superiority to the African race."</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas of Maine, on the other hand, presents
the true basis of Christian chivalry: "I have no desire
to enter into the question of the relative capacity
of races; but if the inferiority of the African race
were established, the inference as to our duty would
be very plain. If this colony has been built up by an
inferior race of men, they have upon us a yet stronger
claim for our countenance, recognition, and, if need
be, protection. The instincts of the human mind and
heart concur with the policy of men and governments
to help and protect the weak. I understand that to a
child or to a woman I am to show a degree of forbearance,
kindness, and of gentleness even, which I
am not necessarily to extend to my equal."</p>

<p>In like manner contrast a passage of sentiment between
two senators on the education bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlile of Virginia, "did not see any good reason
why the Congress of the United States should itself
enter upon a scheme for educating negroes." He understood
"the reason assigned for the government of a
State undertaking the education of the citizens of the
State is that the citizens in this country are the governors;"
but he presumed "we have not yet reached the
point when it is proposed to elevate to the condition
of voters the negroes of the land."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Mr. Grimes in reply said, "It may be true, that, in
that section of the country where the senator is most
acquainted, the whole idea of education proceeds from
the fact, that the person who is to be educated is merely
to be educated because he is to exercise the elective
franchise; but I thank God that I was raised in a section
of the country where there are nobler and loftier
sentiments entertained in regard to education. We
entertain the opinion that all human beings are accountable
beings. We believe that every man should
be taught so that he may be able to read the law by
which he is to be governed, and under which he may
be punished. We believe that every accountable being
should be able to read the word of God, by which
he should guide his steps in this life, and shall be
judged in the life to come. We believe that education
is necessary in order to elevate the human race.
We believe that it is necessary in order to keep our
jails and our penitentiaries and our alms-houses free
from inmates. In my section of the country, we do
not educate any race upon any such low and grovelling
ideas as those that seem to be entertained by the senator
from Virginia."</p>

<p>But the warmest battle was on the question of the
right of colored persons to ride in the cars. The
chivalry maintained their side by such kind of language
as this: "Has any <i>gentleman</i> who was born a
gentleman, or any man who has the instincts of a gentleman,
felt himself degraded by the fact that he was
not honored by a seat beside some free negro? Has
any lady in the United States felt herself aggrieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
that she was not honored with the company of Miss
Dinah or Miss Chloe, on board these cars?"</p>

<p>Again, in the course of the debate, another senator
says of Mr. Sumner, "<i>He</i> may ride with negroes, if
he thinks proper, so may I; but if I see proper not to
do so, I shall follow my natural instincts, as he follows
his."</p>

<p>"I shall vote for this amendment," says Henry Wilson;
"and my own observation convinces me that
justice, not to say decency, requires that I should do
so. Some weeks ago, I rode to the capitol in one of
these cars. On the front part of the car, standing
with the driver, were, I think, five colored clergymen
of the Methodist Episcopal church, dressed like gentlemen,
and behaving like gentlemen. These clergymen
were riding with the driver on the front platform,
and inside the car were two drunken loafers, conducting
and behaving themselves so badly that the conductor
threatened to turn them out."</p>

<p>"The senator from Illinois tells us," said Mr. Wilson,
"that the colored people have a legal right to ride in
these cars now. We know it; nobody doubts it; but
this company into which we breathed the breath
of life, outrages the rights of twenty-five thousand
colored people in this District, in our presence, in defiance
of our opinions. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I tell the senator
from Illinois that I care far more for the rights of the
humblest black child that treads the soil of the District
of Columbia than I do for the prejudices of this corporation,
and its friends and patrons. The rights of
the humblest colored man in the capital of this Christian
nation are dearer to me than the commendations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
or the thanks of all persons in the city of Washington
who sanction this violation of the rights of a race. I
give this vote, not to offend this corporation, not to
offend anybody in the District of Columbia, but to
protect the rights of the poor and the lowly, trodden
under the heel of power. I trust we shall protect
rights, if we do it over prejudices and over interests,
until every man in this country is fully protected in
all the rights that belong to beings made in the image
of God. Let the free man of this race be permitted
to run the career of life; to make of himself all that
God intended he should make, when he breathed into
him the breath of life."</p>

<p>So there they had it, at the mouth of an educated
northern working-man, who knew what man as man was
worth, and the retiring senators, giving up the battle,
wailed forth as follows:</p>

<p>"Poor, helpless, despised, inferior race of white
men, you have very little interest in this government,
you are not worth consideration in the legislation of
this country; but let your superior Sambo's interest
come in question, and you will find the most tender
interest on <i>his</i> behalf. What a pity there is not somebody
to lamp-black white men, so that their rights
could be secured."</p>

<p>Mr. Powell thought that the Senator from Massachusetts,
the next time one of his Ethiopian friends
comes to complain to him on the subject, should bring
an action for him in court, and adds, with the usual
good taste of his party: *&nbsp;* "The Senator has
indicated to his fanatical brethren those people who
meet in free love societies, the old ladies and the sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
preachers, and those who live on fanaticism, that
he has offered it, and I see no reason why we should
take up the time of the Senate in squabbling over the
Senator's amendments, introducing the negro into
every wood-pile that comes along."</p>

<p>Mr. Saulsbury closes a discussion on negro testimony
with the following pious ejaculation: "He did not
wish to say any more about the <i>nigger</i> aspect of
the case. It is here every day; and I suppose it <i>will</i>
be here every day for years to come, till the Democratic
party comes in power and wipes all legislation
of this character out of the statute-book, which I trust
in God they will do."</p>

<p>All this sort of talk, shaken in the face of the joyous
band of brothers who were going on their way
rejoicing, reminds us forcibly of John Bunyan's description
of the poor old toothless giant, who in his
palmy days used to lunch upon pilgrims, tearing their
flesh and cracking their bones in the most comfortable
way possible, but who now having sustained many a
severe brush, was so crippled with rheumatism that
he could only sit in the mouth of his cave, mumbling,
"You will never mend till more of you are burned."</p>

<p>Thank God for the day we live in, and for such men
as Henry Wilson and his compeers of the 37th and
38th Congresses. They have at last put our American
Union in that condition which old Solon gave as his
ideal of true Democracy, namely:</p>

<p>No race has stronger characteristics, bodily or mental,
than that powerful, obstinate, fiery, pious, humorous,
honest, industrious, hard-headed, intelligent,
thoughtful and reasoning people, the Scotch-Irish.
The vigorous qualities of the Scotch-Irish have left
broad and deep traces upon the history of the United
States. As if with some hereditary instinct, they
settled along the great Allegheny ridge, principally
from Pennsylvania to Georgia, in the fertile valleys
and broader expanses of level land on either side,
especially to the westward. In the healthy and genial
air of these regions, renowned for the handsomest
breed of men and women in the world, the Scotch-Irish
acted out with thorough freedom, all the vigorous
and often violent impulses of their nature. They
were pioneers, Indian-fighters, politicians, theologians;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
and they were as polemic in everything else as in theology.
Jackson and Calhoun were of this blood. An
observant traveller in Tennessee described to the writer
the interest with which he found in that state literally
hundreds of forms and faces with traits so like the
lean erect figure, high narrow head, stiff black hair,
and stern features of the fighting old President, that
they might have been his brothers. Many of our eminent
Presbyterian theologians like the late Dr. Wilson,
of Cincinnati, have been Scotch-Irish too, and with their
spiritual weapons they have waged many a controversy
as unyielding, as stern and as unsparing as the battle
in which Jackson beat down Calhoun by showing him
a halter, or as that brutal knife fight in which he and
Thomas H. Benton nearly cut each other's lives out.</p>

<p>Horace Greeley is of this Scotch-Irish race, and after
a rule which physiologists well know to be not
very uncommon, he presents a direct reverse of many
of its traits, more especially its physical ones. Instead
of a lean, erect person, dry hard muscles, a high narrow
head, coarse stiff black hair, and a stern look, he
tends to be fat, is shambling and bowed over in carrying
himself, thinskinned and smooth and fair as a baby,
with a wide, long, yet rounded head, silky-fine almost
white hair, and a habitually meek sort of smile, which
however must not be trusted to as an index of the
mind within. Meek as he looks, no man living is
readier with a strong sharp answer. Non-resistant as
he is physically, there is not a more uncompromising
an opponent and intense combatant in these United
States. Mentally, he shows a predominance of Scotch-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>Irish
blood modified by certain traits which reveal themselves
in his readiness to receive new theories of life.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley was born Feb. 3d, 1811, at his father's
farm, in Amherst, New Hampshire. The town was
part of a district first settled by a small company of
sixteen families of Scotch-Irish from Londonderry.
These were part of a considerable emigration in 1718
from that city, whose members at first endeavored
to settle in Massachusetts; but they were so ill received
by the Massachusetts settlers that they found
it necessary to scatter away into distant parts of the
country before they could find rest for the soles of
their feet.</p>

<p>The ancestors of Mr. Greeley were farmers, those of
the name of Greeley being often also blacksmiths.
The boy was fully occupied with hard farm work, and
he attended the American farmers' college, the District
School. He had an intense natural love for acquiring
knowledge, and learned to read of himself. He could
read any child's book when he was three, and any ordinary
book at four; and having, as his biographer,
Mr. Parton, suggests, still an overplus of mental activity,
he learned to read as readily with the book sideways
or upside down, as right side up.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley, like a number of men who have grown
up to become capable of a vast quantity of hard work
and usefulness, was extremely feeble at birth, and was
even thought scarcely likely to live when he first entered
the world. During his first year he was feeble
and sickly. His mother, who had lost her two children
born next before him, seemed to be doubly fond of
her weak little one, both for the sake of those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
were gone, and of his very weakness, and she kept
him by her side much more closely than if he had been
strong and well; and day after day, she sung and repeated
to him an endless store of songs and ballads,
stories and traditions. This vivid oral literature doubtless
had great influence in stimulating the child's natural
aptitude for mental activity.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley's father was not a much better financier
than his son. In 1820, in spite of all the honest hard-work
that he could do, he became bankrupt, and in
1821 moved to a new residence in Vermont.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley seems to have had such an inborn instinct
after newspapers and newspaper work, as Mozart
had for music and musical composition. He himself
says on this point, in his own "Recollections" in The
New York Ledger, "Having loved and devoured
newspapers&mdash;indeed every form of periodical&mdash;from
childhood, I early resolved to be a printer if I could."
When only eleven years old he applied to be received
as an apprentice in a newspaper office at Whitehall,
Vt., and was greatly cast down by being refused for
his youth. Four years afterwards, in the spring of
1826, he obtained employment in the office of the
Northern Spectator, at East Poultney, Vt., and thus
began his professional career.</p>

<p>As a young man, Mr. Greeley was not only poorly
but most extremely carelessly dressed; absent minded
yet observant; awkward and indeed clownish in his
manners; extremely fond of the game of checkers,
at which he seldom found an equal; and of fishing and
bee-hunting. Fonder still he was of reading and acquiring
general knowledge, for which a public library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
in the town offered valuable advantages; and he very
soon became, as a biographer says, a "town encyclopedia,"
appealed to as a court of last resort, by every
one who was at a loss for information. In the local
debating society of the place he was assiduous and
prominent, and was noticeable both for the remarkable
body of detailed facts which he could bring to
bear upon the questions discussed, and for his thorough
devotion to his argument. Whatever his opinion
was, he stuck to it against either reasoning or authority.</p>

<p>In his calling as a printer, he was most laborious,
and quickly became the most valuable hand in the office.
He also began here his experience as a writer&mdash;if
that may be called written which was never set down
with a pen. For he used to compose condensations of
news paragraphs, and even original paragraphs of his
own, framing his sentences in his mind as he stood at
the case, and setting them up in type entirely without
the intermediate process of setting them down in manuscript.
This practice was exactly the way to cultivate
economy, clearness, and directness of style; as it
was necessary to know accurately what was to be said,
or else the letters in the composing stick would have
to be distributed and set up again; and it was natural
to use the fewest and plainest possible words.</p>

<p>While Horace was thus at work, his father had again
removed beyond the Alleghanies, where he was doing
his best to bring some new land under cultivation.
The son, meanwhile, and for some time after his apprenticeship
too, used to send to his father all the money
that he could save from his scanty wages. He continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
to assist his father, indeed, until the latter was
made permanently comfortable upon a valuable and
well stocked farm; and even paid up some of his
father's old debts in New Hampshire thirty years after
they were contracted.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley has recorded that while in Poultney he
witnessed a fugitive slave chase. New York had then
yet a remainder of slavery in her, in the persons of a
few colored people who had been under age when the
state abolished slavery, and had been left by law to wait
for their freedom until they should be twenty-eight
years old. Mr. Greeley tells the story in the N.&nbsp;Y.
Ledger, in sarcastic and graphic words, as follows:</p>

<p>"A young negro who must have been uninstructed
in the sacredness of constitutional guaranties, the
rights of property, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., feloniously abstracted
himself from his master in a neighboring New York
town, and conveyed the chattel personal to our village;
where he was at work when said master, with due
process and following, came over to reclaim and recover
the goods. I never saw so large a number of
men and boys so suddenly on our village-green, as his
advent incited; and the result was a speedy disappearance
of the chattel, and the return of his master,
disconsolate and niggerless, to the place whence he
came. Everything on our side was impromptu and
instinctive, and nobody suggested that envy or hate
of the South, or of New York, or of the master, had
impelled the rescue. Our people hated injustice and
oppression, and acted as if they couldn't help it."</p>

<p>In June 1830, the Northern Spectator was discontinued,
and our encyclopedic apprentice was turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
loose on the world. Hereupon he traveled, partly on
foot and partly by canal, to his father's place in Western
Pennsylvania. Here he remained a while, and
then after one or two unsuccessful attempts to find
work, succeeded at Erie, Pa., where he was employed
for seven months. During this time his board with his
employer having been part of his pay, he used for
other personal expenses six dollars in cash. The
wages remaining due him amounted to just ninety-nine
dollars. Of this he now gave his father eighty-five,
put the rest in his pocket and went to New York.</p>

<p>He reached the city on Friday morning at sunrise,
August 18th, 1831, with ten dollars, his bundle, and
his trade. He engaged board and lodging at $2.50
a week, and hunted the printing offices for employment
during that day and Saturday in vain; fell in
with a fellow Vermonter early Monday morning, a
journeyman printer like himself, and was by him presented
to his foreman. Now there was in the office a
very difficult piece of composition, a polyglot testament,
on which various printers had refused to work.
The applicant was, as he always had been, and will
be, very queer looking; insomuch that while waiting
for the foreman's arrival, the other printers had been
impelled to make many personal remarks about him.
But though equally entertained with his appearance,
the foreman, rather to oblige the introducer than from
any admiration of the new hand, permitted him a trial,
and he was set at work on the terrible Polyglot. We
transcribe Mr. Parton's lively account of the sequel:</p>

<p>"After Horace had been at work an hour or two,
Mr. West, the 'boss,' came into the office. What his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
feelings were when he saw the new man may be inferred
from a little conversation on the subject which
took place between him and the foreman:</p>

<p>"'Did you hire that d&mdash;&mdash; fool?' asked West, with
no small irritation.</p>

<p>"'Yes; we must have hands, and he's the best I
could get,' said the foreman, justifying his conduct,
though he was really ashamed of it.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said the master, 'for Heaven's sake pay him
off to-night, and let him go about his business.'</p>

<p>"Horace worked through the day with his usual intensity,
and in perfect silence. At night he presented
to the foreman, as the custom then was, the 'proof' of
his day's work. What astonishment was depicted in
the good-looking countenance of that gentleman,
when he discovered that the proof before him was
greater in quantity and more correct than that of any
other day's work on the Polyglot! There was no
thought of sending the new journeyman about his
business now. He was an established man at once.
Thenceforward, for several months, Horace worked
regularly and hard on the Testament, earning about
six dollars a week."</p>

<p>While a journeyman here, he worked very hard indeed,
as he was paid by the piece, and the work was
necessarily slow. At the same time, according to his
habit, he was accustomed to talk very fluently, his first
day's silent labor having been an exception; and his
voluble and earnest utterance, singular, high voice,
fullness, accuracy, and readiness with facts, and positive
though good-natured tenacious disputatiousness,
together with his very marked personal traits, made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
the phenomenon of the office. His complexion was so
fair, and his hair so flaxen white, that the men nicknamed
him "the Ghost." The mischievous juniors played
him many tricks, some of them rough enough, but he
only begged to be let alone, so that he might work,
and they soon got tired of teasing from which there
was no reaction. Besides, he was forever lending
them money, for like very many of the profession, the
other men in the office were profuse with whatever
funds were in hand, and often needy before pay-day;
while his own unconscious parsimony in personal expenditures
was to him a sort of Fortunatus' purse&mdash;an
unfailing fountain.</p>

<p>For about a year and a half Mr. Greeley worked as
a journeyman printer. During 1832 he had become
acquainted with a Mr. Story, an enterprising young
printer, and also with Horatio D. Sheppard, the originator
of the idea of a Cheap Daily Paper. The three
consulted and co-operated; in December the printing
firm of Greeley &amp; Story was formed, and on the first
of January, 1833, the first number of the first cheap
New York Daily, "The Morning Post," was issued,
"price two cents," Dr. Sheppard being editor. Various
disadvantages stopped the paper before the end
of the third week, but the idea was a correct one. The
New York Sun, issued in accordance with it nine
months later, is still a prosperous newspaper; and the
great morning dailies of New York, including the
Tribune, are radically upon the same model.</p>

<p>Though this paper stopped, the job printing firm
of Greeley &amp; Story went on and made money. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
Mr. Story's death, July 9, 1833, his brother-in-law,
Mr. Winchester, took his place in the office. In 1834
the firm resolved to establish a weekly; and on March
22d, 1834, appeared the first number of the Weekly
New Yorker, owned by the firm, and with Mr. Greeley
as editor. He had now found his proper work, and
he has pursued it ever since with remarkable force,
industry and success.</p>

<p>This success, however, was only editorial, not financial,
so far as the New Yorker was concerned. The
paper began with twelve subscribers, and without any
flourishes or promises. By its own literary, political
and statistical value, its circulation rose in a year to
4,500, and afterwards to 9,000. But when it stopped,
Sept. 20, 1841, it left its editor laboring under troublesome
debts, both receivable and payable. The difficulty
was manifold; its chief sources were, Mr. Greeley's
own deficiencies as a financier, supplying too
many subscribers on credit, and the great business
crash of 1837.</p>

<p>During the existence of the New Yorker, Mr. Greeley
also edited two short-lived but influential campaign political
sheets. One of these, the Jeffersonian, was published
weekly, at Albany. This was a Whig paper, which
appeared during a year from March, 1838, and kept
its editor over-busy, with the necessary weekly journey
to Albany, and the double work. The other was
the Log Cabin, the well-known Harrison campaign
paper, issued weekly during the exciting days of
"Tippecanoe and Tyler too," in 1840, and which was
continued as a family paper for a year afterwards.
Of the very first number of this famous little sheet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
48,000 were sold, and the edition rapidly increased to
nearly 90,000. Neither of these two papers, however,
made much money for their editor. But during his labors
on the three, the New Yorker, Jeffersonian, and
Log Cabin, he had gained a standing as a political
and statistical editor of force, information and ability.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley's editorial work on the New Yorker
was a sort of literary spring-time to him. The paper
itself was much more largely literary than the Tribune
now is. In his editorial writing in those days, moreover,
there is a certain rhetorical plentifulness of expression
which the seriousness and the pressures of an
overcrowded life have long ago cut sharply and closely
off; and he even frequently indulged in poetical
compositions. This ornamental material, however,
was certainly not his happiest kind of effort. Mr.
Greeley does his best only by being wholly utilitarian.
Poetry and rhetoric appear as well from his mind as
a great long red feather would, sticking out of his
very oldest white hat.</p>

<p>The great work of Mr. Greeley's life, however&mdash;The
New York Tribune&mdash;had not begun yet, though
he was thirty years old. Its commencement was announced
in one of the last numbers of the Log Cabin,
for April 10, 1841, and its first number appeared on
the very day of the funeral solemnities with which
New York honored the memory of President Harrison.
Mr. Greeley's own account, in one of his articles in
the New York Ledger, is an interesting statement of
his Theory of a Political Newspaper. He says:</p>

<p>"My leading idea was the establishment of a journal
removed alike from servile partizanship on the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
hand, and from gagged, mincing neutrality on the
other. Party spirit is so fierce and intolerant in this
country, that the editor of a non-partizan sheet is restrained
from saying what he thinks and feels on the
most vital, imminent topics; while, on the other hand,
a Democratic, Whig, or Republican journal is generally
expected to praise or blame, like or dislike,
eulogize or condemn, in precise accordance with the
views and interest of its party. I believed there was
a happy medium between these extremes&mdash;a position
from which a journalist might openly and heartily advocate
the principles and commend the measures of
that party to which his convictions allied him, yet dissent
frankly from its course on a particular question,
and even denounce its candidates if they were shown
to be deficient in capacity, or (far worse) in integrity.
I felt that a journal thus loyal to its own convictions,
yet ready to expose and condemn unworthy
conduct or incidental error on the part of men attached
to its party, must be far more effective, even partywise,
than though it might always be counted on to
applaud or reprobate, bless or curse, as the party prejudices
or immediate interest might seem to prescribe."</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley has now been the chief editor of the
Tribune for twenty-six years, and the persistent love
with which he still regards his gigantic child strikingly
appears in the final paragraph of the same article:</p>

<p>"Fame is a vapor; popularity an accident; riches
take wings; the only earthly certainty is oblivion&mdash;no
man can foresee what a day may bring forth; and those
who cheer to-day will often curse to-morrow; and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
I cherish the hope that the Journal I projected and
established will live and flourish long after I shall have
moldered into forgotten dust, being guided by a larger
wisdom, a more unerring sagacity to discover the
right, though not by a more unfaltering readiness to
embrace and defend it at whatever personal cost; and
that the stone which covers my ashes may bear to future
eyes the still intelligible inscription, 'Founder of
<span class="smcap">The New York Tribune</span>.'"</p>

<p>The Tribune began with some 600 subscribers. Of
its first number 5,000 copies were printed, and, as Mr.
Greeley himself once said, he "found some difficulty
in giving them away." At the end of the first week
the cash account stood, receipts, $92; expenditures,
$525. Now the proprietor's whole money capital was
$1,000, borrowed money. But&mdash;as has more than
once been the case with others&mdash;an unjust attack on
the Tribune strengthened it. An unprincipled attempt
was made by the publisher of the Sun, to bribe
and bully the newsmen and then to flog the newsboys
out of selling the Tribune. The Tribune was prompt
in telling the story to the public, and the public showed
that sense of justice so natural to all communities,
by subscribing to it at the rate of three hundred a
day for three weeks at a time. In four weeks it sold
an edition of six thousand, and in seven it sold eleven
thousand, which was then all that it could print. Its
advertising patronage grew equally fast. And what
was infinitely more than this rush of subscribers, a
steady and judicious business man became a partner
with Mr. Greeley in the paper, at the end of July,
not four months from its first issue. This was Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Thomas McElrath, whose sound business management
undoubtedly supplied to the concern an element more
indispensable to its continued prosperity, than any
editorial ability whatever.</p>

<p>The Tribune, as we have seen, like the infant Hercules
in the old fable, successfully resisted an attempt
to strangle it in its cradle. From that time to this, the
paper and its editor have lived in a healthy and invigorating
atmosphere of violent attacks of all sorts, on
grounds political, social, moral and religious. The
paper has not been found fault with, however, for being
flat or feeble or empty. The first noticeable disturbance
after the Sun attack was the Fourierite controversy.
Perhaps Mr. Greeley's Fourierism&mdash;or Socialism,
as it might be better called&mdash;was the principal
if not the sole basis of all the notorious uproars
that have been, made for a quarter of a century about
his "isms," and his being a "philosopher." During
1841 and several following years, the Tribune was the
principal organ in the United States of the efforts then
made to exemplify and prove in actual life the doctrines
of Charles Fourier. The paper was violently
assaulted with the charge that these doctrines necessarily
implied immorality and irreligion. The Tribune
never was particularly "orthodox," and while it vigorously
defended itself, it could not honestly in doing so
say what would satisfy the stricter doctrinalists of the
different orthodox religious denominations. Moreover,
the practical experiments made to organize Fourierite
"phalanxes" and the like, all failed; so that in
one sense, both the Fourierite movement was a failure,
and The Tribune was vanquished in the discussion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
But the controversy was a great benefit to the cause
of associated human effort; and there can be no doubt
that the various endeavors at the present day in progress
to apply the principle of association to the easing
and improving of the various concerns of life, present
a much more hopeful prospect than would have been
the case without the ardent and energetic advocacy
of The Tribune.</p>

<p>The next quarrel was with "the Bloody Sixth,"
as it was called, i. e. the low and rowdy politicians of
the Sixth Ward, then the most corrupt part of the
city. These politicians and their followers, enraged at
certain exposures of their misdeeds in the spring of
1842, demanded a retraction, and only getting a hotter
denunciation than before, promised to come down
and "smash the office." The whole establishment was
promptly armed with muskets; arrangements were
made for flinging bricks from the roof above and spurting
steam from the engine boiler below; but the
"Bloody Sixth" never came.</p>

<p>The Cooper libel suits were in consequence of alleged
libelous matter about J. Fenimore Cooper, who
was a bitter tempered and quarrelsome man, and to the
full as pertinacious as Mr. Greeley himself. This matter
was printed November 17, 1841. The first suit in
consequence was tried December 9, 1842. The damages
were laid at $3,000. Cooper and Greeley each
argued on his own side to the Court, and Cooper got
a verdict for $200. Mr. Greeley went home and wrote
a long and sharp narrative of the whole, for which
Cooper instantly brought another suit; but he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
that his prospect this time did not justify his perseverance,
and the suit never came to trial.</p>

<p>In 1844 Mr. Greeley worked with tremendous intensity
for the election of Henry Clay, but to no purpose.
In February, 1845, the Tribune office was
thoroughly burnt out, but fortunately with no serious
loss. The paper was throughout completely opposed
to the Mexican War. In 1848, and subsequently, the
paper at first with hopeful enthusiasm and at last with
sorrow chronicled the outbreak, progress and fate of
the great Republican uprising in Europe. During the
same year Mr. Greeley served a three months' term in
Congress, signalizing himself by a persistent series of
attacks both in the House and in his paper, on the existing
practice in computing and paying mileage&mdash;a
comparatively petty swindle, mean enough doubtless,
in itself, but very far from being the national evil most
prominently requiring a remedy. This proceeding
made Mr. Greeley a number of enemies, gained him
some inefficient approbations, and did not cure the
evil. In 1857 he went to Europe, to see the "Crystal
Palace" or World's Fair at London, in that year. He
was a member of one of the "juries" which distributed
premiums on that occasion; investigated industrial
life in England with some care; and gave some
significant and influential information about newspaper
matters, in testifying before a parliamentary committee
on the repeal of certain oppressive taxes on newspapers.
He made a short trip to France and Italy;
and on his return home, reaching the dock at New
York about 6 A.&nbsp;M., he had already made up the
matter for an "extra," while on board the steamer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
He rushed at once to the office, seizing the opportunity
to "beat" the other morning papers, by an "exclusive"
extra, sent off for the compositors, who had all
gone to bed at their homes; began setting up the matter
himself; worked away along with the rest until his
exclusive extra was all ready, and then departed contentedly
to his own home.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley had always been a natural abolitionist;
but, with most of the Whig party, he had been willing
to allow the question of slavery to remain in a
secondary position for a long time. He was however
a willing, early, vigorous and useful member of the
Republican party, when that party became an unavoidable
national necessity, as the exponent of Freedom.
With that party he labored hard during the Fremont
campaign, through the times of the Kansas wars, and
for the election of Mr. Lincoln. When the Rebellion
broke out he stood by the nation to the best of his
ability, and if he gave mistaken counsels at any time,
his mistakes were the unavoidable results of his mental
organization, and not in the least due to any conscious
swerving from principle, either in ethics or in
politics.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley has at various times been spoken of as
a candidate for State offices, and he undoubtedly has a
certain share of ambition for high political position&mdash;an
ambition which is assuredly entitled to be excused
if not respected by American citizens. Yet any sound
mind, it is believed, must be forced to the belief that
his highest and fittest place is the Chief Editor's chair
in the office of The Tribune. There he wields a great,
a laboriously and honestly acquired influence, an influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
of the greatest importance to Society. His
friends would be sorry to see him leave that station
for any other.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley's character and career as an editor and
politician can be understood and appreciated by remembering
his key note:&mdash;<i>Benevolent ends, by utilitarian
means</i>.</p>

<p>He desires the amelioration of all human conditions
and the instrumentalities which he would propose are
generally practical, common sense ones. Of magnificence,
of formalities, of all the conventional part
of life, whether in public or private, he is by nature
as utterly neglectful as he is of the dandy element
in costume, but he has a solid and real appreciation of
many appreciable things, which go to make up the
sum total of human advancement and happiness.</p>

<p>The course and character and result of the Rebellion
taught many a great new lesson; in political morals
and in political economy; in international law; in
the theory of governing; in the significance of just principles
on this earth. Perhaps all those lessons, taught
so tremendously to the civilized world, might be
summed in one expression; the Astounding Strength
of a Christian Republic. For, whichever phase of the
Rebellion we examine in considering it as a chapter of
novelties in the world's history, we still come back to
that one splendid, heart-filling remembrance;&mdash;How unexpected,
how unbelieved, how inexhaustible, how
magnificent beyond all history, the strength of the
United States!</p>

<p>"There goes your Model Republic," sneered all the
Upper Classes of Europe, "knocked into splinters in
the course of one man's life! A good riddance!"
And reactionary Europe set instantly to work to league<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
itself with our own traitors, now that the United
States was dead, to bury it effectively. But the Imperial
Republic, even more utterly unconscious than
its enemies, of what it could suffer and could do,
stunned at first and reeling under a blow the most
tremendous ever aimed at any government, clung
close to Right and Justice, and rising in its own blood,
went down wounded as it was, into the thunder and
the mingled blinding lightning and darkness of the
great conflict, unknowing and unfearing whether life
or death was close before. As its day, so was its
strength. As the nation's need grew deeper and more
desperate, in like measure the nation's courage, the
conscious calmness, the unmoved resolution, the
knowledge of strength and wealth and power, grew
more high and strong, and whereas the world knew
that no nation had ever survived such an assault, and
knew, it said, that ours would not, lo and behold,
the United States achieved things beyond all comparison
more unheard of, more wonderful, than even the
treasonable explosion for whose deadly catastrophe all
the monarchists stood joyfully waiting. They were
disappointed. And ever since, they know that if the
Rebellion was not the death-toll of Republics, it was
the death-toll of many other things, and ever since, all
the kings are setting their houses in order.</p>

<p>There were three great national material instrumentalities
which the Free Christian People of the United
States created in their peril, being the sole means which
could have won in the war, and being moreover exactly
the means which England and Europe asserted
that we were peculiarly unable to create or to use;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
they were: the Supply of Money; the Army on the
land, and the Fleet on the sea.</p>

<p>Of these three, the story of the fleet has a peculiar
interest of its own. The United States Navy was
always a popular service in the country, for the adventurous
genius and inventive faculties of our people,
developed and stimulated by its successful prosecution
of commerce, had easily dealt with the naval problems
of fifty years ago. In the war of 1812, the superior
skill of our shipbuilders and sailors launched
and navigated a small but swift and powerful and well
managed navy, and the single common-sense application
of sights for aiming, to our ship-guns, in like manner
as to muskets, gave our sailors a murderous superiority
in sea fights which won us many a victory.</p>

<p>But in times of peace, a free nation almost necessarily
falls behind a standing army nation in respect of
military and naval mechanism and stored material and
readiness of organization; and accordingly, after forty
years of little but disuse, our navy, as the muscles of
an arm shrink away if it is left unmoved, showed little
of the latest improvements in construction and armament,
and indeed there was very little navy to show
at all. At Mr. Lincoln's inauguration, the whole navy
of the United States consisted of seventy-six vessels,
carrying 1,783 guns; and of these, only twelve were
within reach, so effectively had Mr. Buchanan's Secretary
of the Navy, Toucey, dispersed them in readiness
for the secession schemes of his fellows in the cabinet.
And even of those twelve, but a few were in Northern
ports. The navy conspirators had no mind to have a
southern blockade brought down on them, and so took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
good care to send our best ships on long fancy voyages
to Japan or otherwhere&mdash;and to clap on board
of them certain officers whose loyalty and ability they
wished to put out of the way. Thus General Ripley
found himself, to his indignation, over in Asia when
the explosion took place.</p>

<p>It was from this beginning&mdash;practically nothing&mdash;that
the energy and skill of American inventors and
seamen created a navy beyond comparison the strongest
on the face of the earth, reaching a strength of 600
ships, and 51,000 men; which effectively maintained
the most immense and difficult blockade of history;
which performed with brilliant and glorious success,
enterprises whose importance and danger are equal to
any chronicled in the wonderful annals of the sea;
which fully completed its own indispensable share in
the work of subduing the rebellion; and which revolutionized
the theory and practice of naval warfare.</p>

<p>In this chapter of the history of the navy the most
famous name is that of Admiral Farragut, not so much
in consequence of any identification with the mechanical
inventions of the day, as because his past professional
career and his recent brilliant and daring victories,
have linked together the elder with the younger
fame of our navy, and have done it by the exercise of
professional and personal courage and skill, rather than
by the ingenious use of newly discovered scientific
auxiliaries. The hardy courage of unmailed breasts
always appeals more strongly to admiration and sympathy,
than that more thoughtful and doubtless wiser proceeding
which would win fights from behind invulnerable
protections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
A friend of the writer was, during the Rebellion,
investigating some subject connected with the history
of medicine. In one of the books he examined he
found mention made of Charlemagne's physician, a
wonderfully skilful and learned man, named <i>Farraguth</i>.
Our famous Admiral was then in the Gulf of Mexico,
engaged in the preparations for the attack on Mobile
which took place during August of that year. So odd
was this coincidence, that its discoverer wrote to the
Admiral to ask whether he knew any thing of this mediæval
doctor, and received in reply a very friendly
and agreeably written letter, from which some extracts
may here be given without any violation of confidence,
as giving the most authentic information about his ancestry.</p>

<p>"My own name is probably Castilian. My grandfather
came from Ciudadela, in the island of Minorca.
I know nothing of the history of my family before
they came to this country and settled in Florida. You
may remember that in the 17th century, a colony settled
there, and among them, I believe, was my grandfather.
My father served through the war of Independence,
and was at the battle of the Cowpens.
Judge Anderson, formerly Comptroller of the Treasurer,
has frequently told me that my father received
his majority from George Washington on the same day
with himself; and his children have always supposed
that this promotion was for his good conduct in that
fight. Notwithstanding this statement *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
I have never been able to find my father's name in any
list of the officers of the Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
"With two men, Ogden and McKee, he was afterwards
one of the early settlers of Tennessee. Mr.
McKee was a member of Congress from Alabama, and
once stopped in Norfolk, where I was then residing, on
purpose, as he said, to see me, as the son of his early
friend. He said he had heard that I was "a chip of
the old block"&mdash;what sort of a block it was I know not.
This was thirty years ago. My father settled twelve
miles from Knoxville, at a place called Campbell's Station,
on the river, where Burnside had his fight.
Thence we moved to the South, about the time of the
Wilkinson and Blennerhassett trouble. My father was
then appointed a master in the Navy, and sent to New
Orleans in command of one of the gunboats. Hence
the impression that I am a native of New Orleans.
But all my father's children were born in Tennessee,
and as I have said in answer to enquiries on this subject,
we only moved South to crush out a couple of
rebellions.</p>

<p>"My mother died of yellow fever the first summer in
New Orleans, and my father settled at Pascagoula, in
Mississippi. He continued to serve throughout the
'last war,' and was at the battle of New Orleans, under
Commodore Paterson, though very infirm at that
time. He died the following year, and my brothers
and sisters married in and about New Orleans, where
their descendants still remain. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"As to the name, Gen. Goicouria, a Spanish hidalgo
from Cuba, tells me it is Castilian, and is spelled in the
same way as the old physician's&mdash;Farraguth."</p>

<p>Admiral David Glascoe Farragut was born at Campbell's
Station, in East Tennessee, in 1801. While only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
a little boy, at nine years of age, his father, who had
been a friend and shipmate of the hardy sea-king, Commodore
Porter, procured him a midshipman's berth
under that commander, and the boy, accompanying
Porter in the romantic cruise of the Essex, served a
right desperate apprenticeship to his hazardous profession.
His first sea-fight was the short fierce combat
of Porter in the Essex, on April 13th, 1812, with the
English sloop-of-war, Alert. No sooner did the Alert
spy the Essex, than she ran confidently close upon her
weather quarter, and with three cheers opened her
broadside. Porter, not a whit abashed, replied with
such swift fury that the Englishman, smashed into drowning
helplessness, and with seven feet of water in his
hold, struck his colors in eight minutes, escaping out
of the fight by surrender even more hastily than he
had gone into it.</p>

<p>In that desperate and bloody fight in Valparaiso
harbor, when the British captain Hillyar, with double
the force of the Essex, and by means of a most discreditable
breach of the law of neutrality, made an
end of the Essex, Midshipman Farragut, twelve
years of age, stood by his commander to the very last.
When those who could swim ashore had been ordered
overboard, Porter himself, having helped work the
few remaining guns that could be fired, hauled down
his flag, and surrendered the bloody wreck that was
all he had left under him, for the sake of the helpless
wounded men who must have sunk along with him.
Farragut was wounded, and was sent home with the
other officers of the ship, on parole; and Porter, in
his report to the Secretary of the Navy, made special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
and honorable mention of the lad, and mentioned with
the appropriate regret of a just and brave man, that
the boy was "too young for promotion." Probably
not another living man on the face of the earth had
so early and so thorough a baptism of blood and fire,
and bore himself through it so manlike.</p>

<p>Commodore Porter had been so much interested in
the youth that he gave him the means of pursuing an
education in general studies and military tactics. But
Farragut's vocation was the sea, and as soon as the
war was over he got another ship. Peace is the winter
of soldiers and sailors; when they sit still and wait
for the deadly harvest that brings them prosperity.
The times were as dull for Farragut as for the rest,
and for forty-five years he was sailing about the world
or quietly commanding at one or another station, and at
long intervals rising by seniority from one grade to
another. In 1825 he became lieutenant, in 1841 commander,
in 1851 captain. When the rebellion came
he was sixty years old, had been in the service forty-eight
years, and to the country at large was utterly
unknown. This is not strange; for throughout all his
youth and manhood he had had no opportunity to
show the heroic qualities which when a boy of twelve
he had proved himself to possess even then in such
manly measure.</p>

<p>He was living at Norfolk; was a native of the
South; and his second wife, with whom he was now
living, was from a Norfolk family. It was therefore
taken for granted that Farragut would go with the
South, and when he frankly avowed his patriotism, he
was met with astonishment and then with threats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
They told him it would probably be unsafe for him to
remain in the South, with such sentiments. "Very
well," he replied, "I will go where I can live with
such sentiments." Accordingly, he left Norfolk for
the North on the night of April 18, 1861, the very
night before the rebels there fired the navy-yard. He
established himself for a time near Tarrytown, on the
Hudson river. The very air was full of suspicion in
those days, and Captain Farragut being unknown to
the people in the vicinity, and walking about in the
fields alone a good deal, a report got out at one time
among the neighbors that he was one of a gang that
had arranged to cut the Croton Aqueduct and burn
down New York.</p>

<p>Farragut's very first appointment was that to the
command of the naval part of the New Orleans expedition,
for which his orders reached him January 20,
1862, and on Feb. 3d, in his famous flag-ship, the
Hartford, he sailed from Hampton Roads for Ship
Island.</p>

<p>The opening of the Mississippi river has passed
into history. Of all the series of strange and novel
and desperate combats which accomplished the task,
the passage of the forts and the capture of New Orleans
was beyond comparison the most dangerous and
difficult, and its success was the most brilliant. The
services which succeeded this were less showy, but
included much that was excessively laborious, and
that was dangerous enough for any ordinary ambition;
and from beginning to end the whole task required
not only high courage, indefatigable activity, incessant
labor, and the ordinary professional knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
of a sailor, but an invention always ready to contrive
new means for new ends, prompt judgment to adopt
them if suggested by others, wisdom and tact in dealing
with the rebel authorities, and patience in waiting
for the co-operation of the military forces or the development
of the plans of the government. In carrying
his fleet past Port Hudson and Vicksburg, in helping
Grant to cross the river and take the latter place,
in all his operations, whether alone or with the land
commanders, Admiral Farragut gave proof of the possession
of all these qualities.</p>

<p>The "Bay Fight" at Mobile, and the resulting capture
of Forts Powell and Gaines, was another scene as
terrible as New Orleans, and still more splendidly
illuminated by the perfect personal courage of the
Admiral, who has already gone into history, song and
painting, as he stood lashed in the rigging of the old
Hartford, clear above the smoke of the battle, and,
even when he saw the monitor Tecumseh sunk&mdash;the
very ship he had been waiting for for months&mdash;yet
ordered his wooden fleet straight forward despite forts,
gunboats, ram and torpedoes, and won a second victory
of that most glorious sort only possible to the
high, clear and intelligent courage of a leader who is
both truly heroic and truly wise.</p>

<p>The fame which the Admiral earned in the war has
been in some measure paid him, in the testimonials of
admiration and respect which he has received both at
home and abroad. It would require a book to give
account of the greetings and the thanks he has received
from his own countrymen; and on the official
voyage which he has made since the war to the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
ports of Europe, as the representative of the
naval power of the United States. The civilities and
attentions conferred upon himself and his officers, were
not solely that formal politeness which one nation observes
to another, but were in large measure the more
enthusiastic acknowledgment which men pay to lofty
personal qualities.</p>

<p>Admiral Farragut is a man of remarkably pure and
vigorous health, and though no longer young, is more
elastic, vigorous and enduring than most young men.
His health and strength are the just recompense for a
cleanly and temperate life. He seems to have that
sort of innate or constitutional abhorrence for every
unclean thing, which has characterized some great reformers.
There is a pleasant story of a rebuke once
administered by him in a most neat and decorous, but
very effective manner, to a tobacco-smoking bishop,
which conveys a good lesson. At dinner with Farragut,
and after the meal was over, the Bishop, about to
select a cigar, offered the bunch to the sailor. "Have a
cigar, Admiral?" said he. "No, Bishop," said the
Admiral, with a quizzical glance, "I don't smoke&mdash;<i>I
swear a little, sometimes</i>."</p>

<p>We regret that the limits of our sketches do not
allow us to do justice to those wonderful, inspiring,
romantic scenes by which our navy gained possession
of New Orleans and Mobile. But if one wants to
read them in poetry, terse and vivid, with all the fire
of poetry and all the explicitness of prose, we beg
them to read the "River Fight," and "Bay Fight," of
Henry Brownell, who was in both scenes as a volunteer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
officer. There he will find Homeric military ardor
baptized by Christian sentiment.</p>

<p>Among the many heroic men who have sacrificed
their lives in the great battle of liberty in our country,
there is no one who deserves a more honored memory
than John A. Andrew, Governor of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>We speak of him as dying in battle, for it is our
conviction that Governor Andrew was as really a victim
of the war as if, like Lincoln, he had been shot
down by a bullet. His death was caused by an over
tax of the brain in the critical and incessant labors of
the five years' war. He had been previously warned
by a physician that any such strain would expose him
to such a result, so that in meeting the duties and exigencies
of his office at the time he did, he just as certainly
knew that he was exposing himself to sudden
death as the man who goes into battle. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
fail till the battle was over and the victory won, then
with a smile of peace on his lips, he went to rest by
the side of Lincoln.</p>

<p>It was a customary form in the prayers of the Rev.
Dr. Beecher, to offer the petition that God would
make our "Governors as at the first, and our counsellors
as at the beginning." These words, spoken with a
yearning memory of the old days of the pilgrim
fathers, when religion was the law of the land, and the
laws and ordinances of Christ were the standard of
the government, found certainly a fulfillment in the
exaltation of John A. Andrew to be the Governor of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>It has been said of Lincoln by a French statesman
that he presents to the world a new type of pure,
Christian statesmanship. In the same manner it may
be said of John A. Andrew, that he presents a type
of a consistently Christian State Governor.</p>

<p>The noble men of America who have just consummated
in the 37th and 38th Congresses the sublimest
national and moral reform the world ever saw, are the
spiritual children of the pilgrim fathers. So are Garrison,
Phillips, John Brown, and other external helpers
in bringing on the great day of moral victory. They
were men either tracing their descent in lineal blood
to Puritan parentage, or like Garrison, spiritually born
of the eternal influences which they left in the air of
the society they moulded.</p>

<p>These sons of the Puritans do not, it is true, in all
points hold the technical creed of their ancestors, any
more than the Puritans held the creed of the generation
just before them. Progress was the root idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
with the Puritans, and as they stood far in advance in
matters of opinion, so their sons in many respects
stand at a different line from them; in this, quite as
much as in anything else, proving their sonship. The
parting charge of the old pastor Robinson to the little
band of pilgrims was of necessity a seed of changes
of opinion as time should develop fit causes of change.</p>

<p>"If God reveal anything unto you by any other
instrument of his, be ready to receive it as ever you
were to receive any truth by my ministry; for I am
verily persuaded and confident that the Lord hath much
truth yet to break forth from his holy word. For my
part, I cannot sufficiently bewail the condition of the
reformed churches who are come to a period in their
religion, and will go at present no further than the
instruments of their first reformation. The Lutherans
cannot be drawn to go beyond what Luther said; and
whatsoever part of his will our good God has imparted
unto Calvin they will rather die than embrace it. And
the Calvinists you see stick fast where they were left
by that great man of God, who yet saw not all things."</p>

<p>But that part of the Puritan idea which consisted
in unhesitating loyalty to Jesus Christ as master in
practical affairs, and an unflinching determination to
apply his principles and precepts to the conduct of society,
and to form and reform all things in the state by
them, was that incorruptible seed which has descended
from generation to generation in Massachusetts, and
shown itself in the course of those noble men who
have brought on and carried through the late great
revolution. This recent conflict has been in fact <i>a
great revival of religion</i>, by which the precepts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Sermon on the Mount have been established in political
forms.</p>

<p>John Albion Andrew was born in the little town of
Windham, Cumberland county, Maine. It was like
the most of the nests where New England greatness
is hatched&mdash;a little, cold, poor, barren mountain town,
where the winter rages for six months of the year.
We hear of him in these days as a sunny-faced, curly-headed
boy, full of fun and frolic and kind-heartedness,
and we can venture to say how he pattered barefooted
after the cows in the dim grey of summer
mornings, how he was forward to put on the tea-kettle
for mother, and always inexhaustible in obligingness,
how in winter he drew the girls to school on his sled,
and was doughty and valiant in defending snow forts,
and how his arm and prowess were always for the
weak against the strong and for the right against the
wrong. All these inherent probabilities might be
wrought into myths and narratives, which would truly
represent the boy who was father to the man, John
A. Andrew.</p>

<p>He graduated from Bowdoin College in the class of
1837, and came to Boston to study law in the office
of Henry H. Fuller, whence in 1840, he was admitted
to the bar.</p>

<p>During the earlier portions of his educational career,
both in college and at the bar, he had no very brilliant
successes. He had little ambition to dazzle or shine,
or seek for immediate effect; he was indifferent to
academic honors, his heart and mind being set upon
higher things. He read and studied broadly and
carefully, in reference to his whole manhood rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
than to the exigencies of a passing occasion. Besides
his legal studies, he was a widely read belles-lettres
student, and his memory was most retentive of all
sorts of literature, grave and gay, tragic and comic.
He was one that took the journey of life in a leisurely
way, stopping to admire prospects and to gather the
flowers as he went on.</p>

<p>From the very earliest of his associations in Boston,
he allied himself not only with popular and acceptable
forms of philanthropy, but also with those which were
under the ban of polite society. One who knew him
well says: "Few men were connected with so many
unpopular and unfashionable causes. Indeed, it was
only sufficient to know that an alliance with any cause
was considered to involve some loss of social caste, or
business patronage, to be pretty sure that John A.
Andrew was allied with it."</p>

<p>His cheerful, jovial spirit, and the joyousness with
which he accepted the reproach of a cause, took from
it the air of martyrdom. His exquisite flow of natural
humor oiled and lubricated the play of his moral
faculties, so that a gay laugh instead of an indignant
denunciation would be the weapon with which he
would meet injurious language or treatment heaped
on him for conscience sake. Like Lincoln, he had the
happy faculty of being able to laugh where crying
did no good, and the laughter of some good men, we
doubt not, is just as sacred in heavenly eyes as the
tears of others. They who tried to put men under society's
ban for their conscientious opinions, got loss on
their own side in excluding Andrew, since no man had
in a higher degree all the arts and faculties of agreeableness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
in society. No man had a wider or more varied
flow of conversation. No man could tell a better
story or sing a gayer song. No man was more gifted
with that electrical power of animal cheerfulness,
which excites others to gayety and mirth. In the intervals
of the gravest cases, when pressed down, overwhelmed,
and almost bewildered, he would still find
spare hours when at the bedside of some desponding
invalid, or in the cheerless chamber of old age, he
would make all ring again with a flow of mimicry and
wit and fun, as jolly as a bob-o-link on a clover head.</p>

<p>Some of the most affecting testimonials to his worth
come from these obscure and secluded sources. One
aged friend of seventy or more, tells how daily, amid
all the cares of the state house and the war, he found
some interval to come in and shed a light and cheerfulness
in her shaded chamber.</p>

<p>His pastor speaks of him as performing the duties
of a Sunday school superintendent during the labors
of his arduous station. He was a lover of children
and young people, and love made labor light. While
he did not hesitate, when necessary, to carry forward
the great public cause on the Sabbath day, yet his
heart and inclinations ever inclined him to the more
purely devotional uses of those sacred hours. The
flame of devotion in his heart was ever burning beneath
the crust of earthly cares, but ready to flame
up brightly in those hours consecrated by the traditions
of his Puritan education.</p>

<p>In one respect Governor Andrew was not patterned
on the old first magistrates of Massachusetts. Massachusetts
was at first decidedly an aristocratic community.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
A certain of idea rank and stateliness hedged in
the office of the governor. He stood above the people
at an awful distance and moved among them as a
sort of superior being.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more opposed to the frank, companionable
nature of Governor Andrew than any such
idea. He was a true democrat to the tips of his finger
nails, and considered a Governor only as the servant
of the people. In this respect, more truly than
even the first Puritan governors, did he express the
idea given by Christ of rank and dignity, "Whosoever
will be chief among you let him be your servant."</p>

<p>Governor Andrew from the first rejected and disclaimed
everything which seemed to mark him out
from the people by outward superiority. He chose to
live in a small, plain house, in a retired and by no
means fashionable part of the city, and to conduct all
his family arrangements on a scale of the utmost simplicity.
When the idea was suggested to him that
the Governor of Massachusetts ought to have some
extra provision to enable him to appear with more
worldly pomp and stateliness, he repelled it with energy,
"Never, while the country was struggling under
such burdens, and her brave men bearing such privations
in the field, would he accept of anything more
than the plain average comforts of a citizen." The
usual traditional formulas and ceremonials of his position
were only irksome and embarrassing to him. One
of his aids relates that being induced by urgent solicitation
to have the accustomed military coat of the
Governor of Massachusetts, with all its gold lace and
buttons, he wore it twice, and then returning with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
aids to his private cabinet, he pulled it off and threw
it impatiently into a corner, saying, "Lie there, old
coat&mdash;you won't find me wearing you again, soon."
The ceremonies on public occasions were always irksome
and fatiguing to him, and he would recreate
himself by singing "Johnny Schmauker" with his aids
in his private apartments afterwards. We think good
Governor Winthrop would have rolled up his eyes in
horror at such carelessness of etiquette and station.</p>

<p>As a public man, Governor Andrew was distinguished
for quickness, perspicasity, and energy. The
electric, social element of his being made him an
apt reader of human nature, and gave him that
prophetic insight into what would arise from the doings
of men, which enabled him to see afar off and
provide for possible emergencies. Thus at the time
he was appointed Governor, nothing was farther from
the thoughts of the body of Northern men than that
there could ever be really and in fact a war in America.
All the war talk and war threats that had come
from the South had been pleasantly laughed at, as
mere political catch words and nursery tales meant to
frighten children.</p>

<p>But Andrew felt the atmosphere chilling with the
coming storm, and from the moment of his election,
he began making active preparations for war, which
were at the time as much laughed at as Noah's for the
flood.</p>

<p>But the time came which the laughers and skeptics
said would not come, and behold on the 15th of April,
the President's requisition for troops! Thanks to the
previous steps taken by Governor Andrew, the Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
sixth regiment started from Boston in the
afternoon of the 17th, leaving the 4th all but ready to
follow. <i>Only one day</i> was necessary to get a thousand
men started&mdash;and this company was the first that entered
Washington <i>in uniform</i> and with all the moral
effect of uniformed soldiers. This leads us to the
celebrated story of the blue overcoats, which is this:
Shortly after Lincoln's election, Benjamin F. Butler
took tea with Jefferson Davis in Washington, and there
satisfied himself in personal conversation that a war
must be the result of the machinations that were going
on. He posted to Boston and communicated what
he knew to Governor Andrew, who immediately called
a secret session of the legislature in which he told the
crisis and asked for an appropriation to get troops in
readiness. They voted twenty-five thousand dollars
which Governor Andrew put into arms, ammunition
and stores for an immediate equipment for the field.
Among other things, he had two or three thousand
army overcoats made and stored in the State house.</p>

<p>When the call came, the sixth regiment had not half
a quota, but was immediately made up by the fiery zeal
of enlisting citizens, who contended for places and
even paid large bounties to buy the chance to go.
They came into Boston an army of zealous new recruits.
The Governor uniformed them at one stroke
with his overcoats, and had each man's outfit ready for
him so that in one day they were marching from Boston
to the capital; and in six days, on Sunday, he was
able to announce to the government that the whole
quota of men required of Massachusetts were already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
either in Washington or in Fortress Monroe, on their
way thither.</p>

<p>When news came back of the fight in Baltimore,
and the murder of some of his brave men, Andrew
sent a telegram which showed that if he did not care
to wear the uniform of a Massachusetts Governor, he
knew how to assert the honor of Massachusetts, and to
make other States feel that she had a Chief Magistrate
in whose sight the blood of every Massachusetts man
was sacred.</p>

<p>He telegraphed to the Mayor of Baltimore:</p>

<p>"I pray you let the bodies of our Massachusetts
soldiers, dead in Baltimore, be laid out, preserved in ice,
and tenderly sent forward by express to me. All expenses
will be paid by the commonwealth."</p>

<p>The tender and fatherly feeling expressed in this
telegram is the key note to all Governor Andrew's conduct
of the war. Though he would not waste one
cent on the trappings of rank, or his own personal dignity
or convenience, he gave unlimited orders for
marks of tender and delicate devotion to even the remains
of the brave who had fallen for their country.</p>

<p>In the same manner he gave himself no rest, in his
labors for the families of the brave men who were in
the field. This interest was the deeper, the humbler
the walk in life of its objects.</p>

<p>The British minister, Sir Frederick Bruce, once
called upon him at the State House, and found the
room nearly filled with colored women who had come
to hear news of fathers, brothers and sons enlisted in
the black regiments of Massachusetts. He waited patiently
while the Governor inquired into the sorrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
and grievances, and listened to the perplexities of these
poor anxious souls, and tried in his hopeful cheery way
to smooth away difficulties and inspire hope. It was
not till the humblest and poorest had had their say,
that the turn of the British Minister came, who, as he
shook the Governor's hand, said that the scene before
him had given him a new idea of the paternal character
of a Republican Government.</p>

<p>Of a like nature is another anecdote, one of many
which since the Governor's death, have risen like flowers
upon his grave.</p>

<p>A poor woman, the wife of a soldier, came to his
room to have some business done in relation to the
pension of a poorer sister. The Governor told her
that her application must be made at another bureau
in another part of the State house. Observing something
of delicacy and timidity in her air, he asked her
where she lived and finding it out of Boston, enquired
if she had any friends or relations in the city with
whom she could rest during the hours before the opening
of the office. Finding that she was utterly a stranger
in Boston, and evidently in delicate health, the
Governor provided her a sofa in a private nook and
told her to rest herself, and offered her from his own
frugal stores a glass of wine and a cracker for refreshment.
The fatherly kindness and consideration of his
manner was more even, than the favors he gave.</p>

<p>His sympathy with the soldiers in the field was a
sort of personal identification. He put himself into
the Massachusetts army and could say as Paul said of
the churches: "who is weak, and I am not weak? who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
is offended, and I burn not?" One incident illustrative
of this is thus related by Edwin Whipple in his eulogy:</p>

<p>Receiving, in the depth of winter, an urgent request
from the War Office that a regiment, not yet properly
equipped, should be sent immediately to Washington,
he despatched it on the assurance that all its wants
should be supplied on its arrival. Hearing that it had
been stopped on the way, and that it was undergoing
cruel privations, he started instantly for the camp, determined
at least to share the misery he might not be
able to relieve; and he would not budge an inch until
the regiment was sent on to its destination. Indeed
he would have blushed to enter heaven, carrying thither
the thought that he had regarded his own comfort
rather than the least duty he owed to the poorest soldier-citizen.</p>

<p>The proclamations of Governors, Presidents and
public men have generally been mere stately generalities
and formalities. But with the great stirring of the
deeper religious feelings of the community, these papers
on the part of our public men have become individual
and human&mdash;animated by a deeply religious spirit.</p>

<p>The proclamations of Governor Andrew for the
usual State Thanksgivings and fasts, customary in Massachusetts
were peculiar and unusual documents, and
show more than any thing else how strongly the spirit
and traditions of his old Puritan ancestry wrought in
him, and how completely his mind was permeated with
the Hebraistic imagery of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>His first thanksgiving proclamation after the commencement
of the war, is a document worth preserving
entire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p2 smaller">"<span class="smcap">By His Excellency John A. Andrew, Governor: A proclamation

<p>"The example of the Fathers, and the dictates of piety
and gratitude, summon the people of Massachusetts,
at this, the harvest season, crowning the year
with the rich proofs of the Wisdom and Love of God,
to join in a solemn and joyful act of united Praise and
Thanksgiving to the Bountiful Giver of every good
and perfect gift.</p>

<p>"I do, therefore, with the advice and consent of the
Council, appoint Thursday, the twenty-first day of November
next&mdash;the same being the anniversary of that
day, in the year of our Lord sixteen hundred and
twenty, on which the Pilgrims of Massachusetts, on
board the May Flower, united themselves in a solemn
and written compact of government&mdash;to be observed
by the people of Massachusetts as a day of Public
Thanksgiving and Praise. And I invoke its observance
by all people with devout and religious joy.</p>

<p>"Sing aloud unto God, our strength; make a joyful
noise unto the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>"Take a Psalm and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant
harp with psaltery.</p>

<p>"Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time
appointed, on our solemn feast day.</p>

<p>"For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the
God of Jacob. Psalms 81, v. 1 to 4.</p>

so that 'our paths drop fatness.'</p>

<p>"For the many and gentle alleviations of the hardships
which in the present time of public disorder have
afflicted the various pursuits of industry.</p>

<p>"For the early evidence of the reviving energies of
the business of the people:</p>

<p>"For the measure of success which has attended the
enterprise of those who go down to the sea in ships,
of those who search the depths of the ocean to add to
the food of man, and of those whose busy skill and
handicraft combine to prepare for various use the crops
of the earth and sea:</p>

<p>"For the advantages of sound learning, placed within
the reach of all children of the people, and the freedom
and alacrity with which these advantages are embraced
and improved:</p>

<p>"For the opportunities of religious instruction and
worship, universally enjoyed by consciences untrammelled
by any human authority:</p>

<p>"For the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ,
for the means of grace and the hope of glory:</p>

<p>"And with one accord let us bless and praise God for
the oneness of heart, mind and purpose in which he
has united the people of this ancient Commonwealth
for the defence of the rights, liberties, and honor, of
our beloved country.</p>

the devoted lives of our fathers, the precious inheritance
of freedom received at their hands, the
weight of glory which awaits the faithful, and the infinity
of blessing which it is our privilege, if we will,
to transmit to the countless generations of the future.</p>

<p>"And while our tears flow, in a stream of cordial
sympathy, with the daughters of our people, just now
bereft, by the violence of the wicked and rebellious, of
the fathers and husbands and brothers and sons, whose
heroic blood has made verily sacred the soil of Virginia,
and mingling with the waters of the Potomac, has
made the river now and forever ours; let our souls
arise to God on the wings of Praise, in thanksgiving
that He has again granted to us the privilege of living
unselfishly, and of dying nobly, in a grand and righteous
cause:</p>

<p>"For the precious and rare possession of so much devoted
valor and heroism:</p>

<p>"For the sentiment of pious duty which distinguished
our fathers in the camp and in the field:</p>

<p>"And for the sweet and blessed consolations which
accompany the memories of these dear sons of Massachusetts
on to immortality:</p>

<p>"And in our praise let us also be penitent. Let us
'seek the truth and ensue it,' and prepare our minds
for whatever duty shall be manifested hereafter.</p>

<p>"May the controversy in which we stand be found
worthy in its consummation of the heroic sacrifices of
the people and the precious blood of their sons, of the
doctrine and faith of the fathers, and consistent with
the honor of God and with justice to all men.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="p2">The next year, 1862, the annual thanksgiving proclamation
has the following characteristic close:</p>

<p>"Rising to the height of our great occasion, re-enforced
by courage, conviction and faith, it has been
the privilege of our country to perceive, in the workings
of Providence, the opening ways of a sublime
Duty. And to Him who hath never deserted the
faithful, unto Him 'who gathereth together the outcasts
of Israel, who healeth the broken in heart,' we
owe a new song of thanksgiving. 'He sheweth his
word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto
Israel. He has not dealt so with any nation.'</p>

<p>"Putting aside all fear of man, which bringeth a
snare, may this people put on the strength which is
the divine promise and gift to the faithful and obedient;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
'Let the high praises of God be in their mouth,
and a two edged sword in their hand.' Not with
malice and wickedness, but with sincerity and truth,
let us keep this feast; and while we 'eat the fat and
drink the sweet, forget not to send a portion to him for
whom nothing is prepared.' Let us remember on that
day the claims of all who are poor, or desolate, or oppressed,
and pledge the devotion of our lives to the
rescue of our country from the evils of rebellion, oppression
and wrong; and may we all so order our
conduct hereafter, that we may neither be ashamed to
live, nor afraid to die."</p>

<p>When the war was over, and the victory won, the
generous and brotherly spirit of Governor Andrew
showed itself in the instant outflowing of charity
towards our misguided and suffering brethren, and he
was one of the first and warmest to respond to the
cry for aid to the starving thousands at the South.
"I was for a vigorous prosecution of the war while
there was a war," he said, "but now the war is over,
I am for a vigorous prosecution of the peace."</p>

<p>It is not generally known that the moment the national
flag made Richmond a safe place to be visited
by northern men, teachers were at once sent from
Boston to found a series of common schools for the
poor white children of Richmond. The building formerly
employed as a laboratory for the preparing of
torpedos and other implements of war, was converted
into a school room for these poor vagrants, who had
suffered from cold, hunger and neglect during the
chances of the war. The teachers carried with them
not only school books for the children, but gifts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
clothing and supplies of food, whereby they carried
comfort to many a poor family. In this most peculiarly
Christian work, Governor Andrew sympathized
deeply. His was a nature that, while it could be surpassed
by none in energetic resistance to wrong, was
ever longing the rather to express itself in deeds of
kindness.</p>

<p>Governor Andrew's farewell address to the Legislature
of Massachusetts was a state paper worthy of the
State and worthy of him. We shall make a few extracts:</p>

<p>"At the end of five years of executive administration,
I appear before a convention of the two Houses
of her General Court, in the execution of a final duty.
For nearly all that period, the Commonwealth, as a
loyal State of the American Union, has been occupied
within her sphere of co-operation, in helping to maintain,
by arms, the power of the nation, the liberties
of the people, and the rights of human nature.</p>

<p>"Having contributed to the army and the navy&mdash;including
regulars, volunteers, seamen and marines,
men of all arms, and officers of all grades, and of the
various terms of service&mdash;an aggregate of one hundred
and fifty-nine thousand one hundred and sixty-five
men; and having expended for the war, out of
her own treasury, twenty-seven million seven hundred
and five thousand one hundred and nine dollars,&mdash;besides
the expenditures of her cities and towns, she has
maintained, by the unfailing energy and economy of
her sons and daughters, her industry and thrift even
in the waste of war. She has paid promptly, and <i>in
gold</i>, all interest on her bonds&mdash;including the old and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
the new&mdash;guarding her faith and honor with every public
creditor, while still fighting the public enemy; and
now, at last, in retiring from her service, I confess the
satisfaction of having first seen all of her regiments
and batteries (save two battalions) returned and mustered
out of the army; and of leaving her treasury
provided for, by the fortunate and profitable negotiation
of all the permanent loan needed or foreseen&mdash;with
her financial credit maintained at home and
abroad, her public securities unsurpassed, if even
equalled, in value in the money market of the world
by those of any State or of the Nation.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"But, perhaps, before descending for the last time
from this venerable seat, I may be indulged in some
allusion to the broad field of thought and statesmanship,
to which the war itself has conducted us. As I
leave the Temple where, humbled by my unworthiness,
I have stood so long, like a priest of Israel
sprinkling the blood of the holy sacrifice on the altar&mdash;I
would fain contemplate the solemn and manly
duties which remain to us who survive the slain, in
honor of their memory and in obedience to God."</p>

<p>The Governor then goes on to state his views of
reconstruction, and we will say no state paper ever
more truly expressed the Christian idea of statesmanship
as applied to the most profound problem of
modern times.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it seems to us that Governor Andrew
so fully lived in the spirit of the old Christian Governors
of Massachusetts, that the words of Cotton
Mather, in his mourning for Governor Winthrop, fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
apply to him: "We are now," he says, "to mourn for
a governor who has been to us as a friend in his counsel
for all things, help for our bodies by physic, for
our estate by law, and of whom there was no fear of
his becoming an enemy, like the friends of David; a
governor who hath been unto us as a brother; not
usurping authority over the church; often speaking
his advice, and often contradicted, even by young
men, and some of low degree; yet not replying, but
offering satisfaction when any supposed offences have
arisen; a governor who has been to us as a mother,
parent-like distributing his goods to brethren and
neighbors at his first coming, and gently bearing our
infirmities without taking notice of them."</p>

<p>It is pleasant to record for the honor of republics,
that while the disinterestedness of Governor Andrew
had left him in honorable poverty, the contributions
of Boston and Massachusetts immediately flowed in to
supply to his family that estate which their father's
patriotism and devotion did not allow him to seek for
them. There must have been thousands of grateful
hearts in Massachusetts, in homes of comparative indigence
whence have come joyful contributions to that
testimonial of Massachusetts to her beloved and faithful
citizen Governor.</p>

<p>General William Colfax, the grandfather of Hon.
Schuyler Colfax, was a citizen of New Jersey, and
was the commanding officer of Gen. Washington's
life guards throughout the Revolutionary War. His
holding that very confidential and responsible post is
sufficient evidence of his steadiness, sense, courage and
discretion. It is a further testimonial to the same effect,
that Gen. Colfax latterly became one of the most
intimate personal friends of the great revolutionary
chieftain. Gen. Colfax's wife was Hester Schuyler, a
cousin of Gen. Philip Schuyler.</p>

<p>General Colfax's son, Schuyler Colfax, the father of
the Speaker, was an officer of one of the New York
city banks, and died four months before his son was
born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Schuyler Colfax was born in New York city, March
23, 1823, and was the only son of his widowed mother.
He was taught in the common schools of the city&mdash;finished
his education at the high school then standing
in Crosby St., and at ten years had received all the
school training he ever had. He now became a clerk
in a store, and after three years removed to Indiana
with his mother and her second husband, a Mr. Matthews.
They settled in St. Joseph County. Here the
youth for four years again served as clerk in the village
of New Carlisle. When 17 years old he was appointed
deputy county auditor, and for the better fulfilment
of his official duties, he now removed to the
county town, South Bend, where he has lived ever
since.</p>

<p>Like almost every western citizen of any activity
of body and mind, young Colfax took practical hold
of political matters about as soon as he could vote.
He talked and thought, and began to print his views
from time to time in the local newspaper of the place.
His peculiar faculty of dealing fairly and at the same
time pleasantly, with men of all sorts, his natural sobriety
and sensibleness of opinion, and his power of
stating things plainly and correctly, made him what
may be called a natural newspaper man. He was employed
during several sessions to report the proceedings
of the State Senate for the Indianapolis Journal,
and in this position made many friends, and gained a
good reputation for political information and ability as
a writer.</p>

<p>In 1845, he became proprietor and editor of the
"St. Joseph Valley Register," the local paper of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
town, South Bend. This was the beginning of his
independent career, and if hope had been absent, the
prospect would have looked meagre enough. He was
a youth of just over twenty-one, and he had two hundred
and fifty subscribers. But the youthful editor
had hope, and what was far more important, remarkable
tact and capacity for his laborious profession. By
good fortune and perseverance, he was able to tide
over the first dangerous crisis for a poor man who undertakes
a large literary enterprise&mdash;the period of
maximum debt, so fatal to new periodicals. This is a
point like the darkest hour just before day, when the
newspaper or magazine is very likely steadily gaining
in reputation and even in circulation, but when the
circulation has not quite reached the paying point,
and the paper bills have been postponed to the latest
possible moment, while the constant outgoes for paying
the journeymen, and for the other weekly office
expenses, have kept up their monotonous drain. With
Mr. Colfax this period was at the end of the first year
of his paper, when he owed $1,375. The concern
gradually became productive, however. A few years
afterwards the office was burned down, and the uninsured
editor was left to begin his business over again.
He did so, and has earned a very comfortable living
by it, though he is by no means a rich man.</p>

<p>Besides paying well, the "Register," as conducted
by Mr. Colfax, is entitled to the much higher praise
of having been a useful, interesting and a morally pure
paper, always on the side of what is good and right
in morals and in society. It has been, for instance,
constantly in favor of temperance reform; and it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
always avoided the masses of vile detail which so
many papers of respectable position manage to distribute
in families under pretence that they must give
full news of police reports and criminal trials.</p>

<p>Mr. Colfax was a Whig as long as there was a Whig
party, and at its death, like all its members of clear
heads, progressive tendencies, and decided character,
he joined the Republican party. Before the rise of
this great new organization, however, he had already
risen to considerable influence in the Whig party, and
had held several positions of political trust. In 1848
he was a delegate to the convention which nominated
Gen. Taylor, and was one of its secretaries. In 1849
he was a member of the convention which revised the
constitution of the State of Indiana, having been chosen
in a manner especially honorable to him personally,
as his district was politically opposed to him. Mr.
Colfax, in this convention, was considered a judicious
legislator, a ready debater and a fine speaker. A little
after this time he declined a nomination to the Indiana
Senate, for the sufficient reason that he could not afford
at that time to be absent from his business.</p>

<p>Mr. Colfax's first nomination for Congress was in
1851, and he was beaten, though only by 200 majority,
in a district strongly opposed to him in politics.
His competitor was that Dr. Graham N. Fitch who
was afterwards the congenial yokefellow of Mr. Bright
in the U.&nbsp;S. Senate, on the side of the South, during
Mr. Buchanan's presidency. Mr. Colfax's friends were
of opinion, however, that the fatal 200 against him
were illegal votes, imported by means of a certain
railroad then constructing in those parts, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
among the laborers employed upon it. In 1852 he
was a delegate to the Whig National Convention that
nominated Gen. Scott, and as at the convention of
1848, was a secretary. He declined a second congressional
nomination, and his district, which he had
lost by only 200, was now lost by 1,000.</p>

<p>The Thirty-Third Congress, whose legal existence
covered the period from Dec. 5, 1853, to March 3,
1855, Franklin Pierce being President, passed the Nebraska
Bill. Upon this, the North, driven at last to
the wall, turned short about in its career of surrender,
and set itself to put a limit to the spread of slavery.
The old established professional politicians of those
days did not understand this crisis, and very many of
them did not know anything about the change of
public opinion&mdash;or rather of public intention&mdash;that
was going on, until to their immense surprise and disgust,
an anti-slavery-extension constituency that they
knew not of, suddenly voted them out of their offices.
Such a bat-eyed politician was Mr. Colfax's own representative
in Congress at this time. Even after having
been elected as a Free Soil Democrat, and after
undergoing a special season of argument and entreaty
by his friends and neighbors during a visit home while
the Nebraska Bill was pending, the short-sighted legislator
went back and voted for it. He very quickly
reaped his reward, however. Had he known enough to
take the opportunity of doing right, he would have
found out that for once it was the way to temporal success,
for unquestionably he would have been re-elected,
and assuredly Mr. Colfax would have done his best to
re-elect him. As it was, the energetic editor was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
once selected by the anti-Nebraska men of that region
to take the lead in punishing the delinquent. He
was unanimously chosen candidate for Congress, and
after the candid and jolly western fashion, the two
nominees went round the district, yoked together for
combat, like those duellists who are tied together by
their left wrists and wield their knives with their right
hands. The result was, Mr. Colfax's election by 2,000
majority, the previous majority of his competitor having
been 1,000 the other way.</p>

<p>When the Thirty-Fourth Congress met, Dec. 3d,
1855, there was a majority opposed to the administration,
but this opposition was of materials inharmonious
among themselves. The anti-Nebraska members,
properly so called, numbered about 108, the administration
men, or Democrats, about 75, the third party,
or "Know Nothing" men about 40; and there were
a few who could not be classified. Now, the anti-Nebraska
men alone had twenty less than the necessary
majority (128) out of the 234 members of the House;
and if the Know Nothings and Democrats should effect
a complete union, they could choose a Speaker.
Whether they would do so was the principal question
of the famous contest for the Speakership which now
ensued, which lasted from Dec. 3, 1855, to Feb. 2,
1856, two full months, and which resulted in the election
of Mr. Banks&mdash;the first formal national triumph
of the national anti-slavery sentiment. Its importance
might be overlooked, but it was great, and lay in this:
that the Speaker has power to constitute the committees
of the House&mdash;who prepare and in very great
measure decide, all its business&mdash;just as he pleases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Accordingly, if he were a pro-slavery man, past experience
gave full guarantee that those committees would
be so formed as to effectually silence the voice of the
anti-slavery sentiment of the House, and to bejuggle
the whole of its legislation into an apparent and deceitful
endorsement of the administration. To resist
this dangerous and humiliating result, required, under
the circumstances, a good deal of courage, both moral
and physical, and powers of endurance almost equal
to the extremities of a siege; but the resolute phalanx
of the anti-slavery men, cheered daily by their
consciences within, and the earnest and increasing applause
of every friend of man without, fought the
battle bravely through.</p>

<p>During the contest, Mr. Colfax, who was a steady
and unflinching soldier on the right side, served his
cause at one very critical moment. It was the end of
the first month of the struggle. There had been sixty
or seventy ballots, and for the last thirty or forty of
them the votes had been just about the same; for
Banks, anti-Nebraska, 103 to 106; Richardson, Democratic,
74 or 75; Fuller, Know Nothing, 37 to 41;
and Pennington, a second anti-Nebraska candidate, 5
to 8. Various experiments had been tried to relieve
the dead-lock. It had been suggested that the lowest
candidate should be dropped at each vote, until one
of the last two must be chosen; that after three ballots,
the candidate having most votes should be elected;
and other plans were submitted, but all to no effect.
About the end of December, Mr. Campbell, of
Ohio, elected as an anti-Nebraska man, but of a sufficiently
singular sort, either very unwise or very unsound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
offered a resolution that Mr. Orr of South
Carolina, "be invited to preside temporarily until a
Speaker be elected." This extremely sly contrivance
came within a hair-breadth of succeeding; for it looked
like a mere amicable expedient to facilitate business,
while it was in fact almost certain that once in,
the subtle and energetic Orr, aided by the whole
South, the Democrats, most of the Know Nothings,
and perhaps some weak brethren of the anti-slavery
opposition, would stay in. A motion to lay Campbell's
resolution on the table failed by a majority of
twenty; it looked as if Orr would be really Speaker
in five minutes. Mr. Colfax now rose in the very
nick of time, and made a motion which irresistibly
reminds us of the device with which Hushai confounded
the wisdom of Ahithophel. It was an amendment
proposing to put the three contending parties on a
fair equality during the contest, by allowing each to
elect a temporary chairman, and these three to preside
alternately in the order they might themselves agree
upon. On this motion debate arose; there was a recess
before any vote was reached; and the dangerous
plan for making Orr Speaker was staved off. By next
morning, Campbell's friends succeeded in inducing
him to withdraw his resolution, and the contest settled
back to its monotonous course of roll-calls and adjournments,
until the final adoption of a plurality
rule by the administration men, who, when they did
it, thought it would help them, and the consequent
election of Banks, at the 134th ballot, February 2d,
1856, by 103 to 100 for Aiken. The Know Nothings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
nearly all went to the Democratic side when the real
pinch came.</p>

<p>It was during this session&mdash;June 21, 1856,&mdash;that Mr.
Colfax delivered his well known and powerful speech
on the bogus "Laws" of Kansas, imposed on that
State by the fraud and violence of the pro-slavery ruffians
of those days. This speech, a word-for-word quotation
of clause after clause of this infamous code, accompanied
with a plain, sober and calmly toned explanation
of the same, produced a very great effect, and
was considered so able a summary of the case involved,
that during the Presidential campaign of that year, a
half million of copies of it were distributed among
the voters of the United States. By way of driving
quite home the truths of the case, Mr. Colfax, where
he quoted the clause which inflicted imprisonment at
hard labor <i>with ball and chain</i>, upon any one who
should ever <i>say</i> "that persons have not the right to
hold slaves in this Territory," lifted from his desk and
showed to the House an iron ball of the statutory dimensions
(viz., 6 inches diameter, weighing about 30
lbs.), apologizing for not also exhibiting the six-foot chain
prescribed along with it. Alexander H. Stephens, afterwards
Vice President of the Rebels, who sat close
by, asked to take this specimen of pro-slavery jewelry
for freemen, and having tested its weight, would have
returned it. But Mr. Colfax smilingly asked him to
hold it for him until he was through speaking, and
while the pro-slavery leader dandled the decoration
proposed by his friends for men guilty of free speech,
Mr. Colfax, in a few telling sentences, showed that
Washington and Jefferson and Webster and Clay had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
said the words which would have harnessed them, a
quaternion of convicts, into the chain-gang of the border
ruffians.</p>

<p>The close of this weighty speech is here quoted,
not merely for the noble tone of its assertion of lofty
principles, but also for the sake of showing the opportune
manner in which, by citing one of the departed
great men of our land, he at once added to his argument
the strength of a mighty name, did justice to a
man much spoken against but of many noble traits,
and also illustrated a striking peculiarity of Mr. Colfax
himself&mdash;the warmth, strength and unending persistency
of his friendship. He closed as follows:</p>

<p>"As I look, sir, to the smiling valleys and fertile
plains of Kansas, and witness there the sorrowful
scenes of civil war, in which, when forbearance at last
ceased to be a virtue, the Free State men of the Territory
felt it necessary, deserted as they were by their
Government, to defend their lives, their families, their
property, and their hearthstones, the language of one
of the noblest statesmen of the age, uttered six years
ago at the other end of this Capitol, rises before my
mind. I allude to the great statesman of Kentucky,
Henry Clay. And while the party which, while he
lived, lit the torch of slander at every avenue of his
private life, and libelled him before the American people
by every epithet that renders man infamous, as a
gambler, debauchee, traitor, and enemy of his country,
are now engaged in shedding fictitious tears over his
grave, and appealing to his old supporters to aid by
their votes in shielding them from the indignation of
an uprisen people, I ask them to read this language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
of his, which comes to us as from his tomb to-day. With
the change of but a single geographical word in the
place of "Mexico," how prophetically does it apply to
the very scenes and issues of this year! And who can
doubt with what party he would stand in the coming
campaign, if he were restored to us from the damps
of the grave, when they read the following, which fell
from his lips in 1850, and with which, thanking the
House for its attention, I conclude my remarks.</p>

<p>"But if, unhappily, we should be involved in war, in
civil war, between the two parties of this Confederacy,
in which the effort upon the one side should be
to restrain the introduction of slavery into the new
Territories, and upon the other side to force its introduction
there, what a spectacle should we present to
the astonishment of mankind, in an effort not to propagate
rights, but&mdash;I must say it, though I trust it will
be understood to be said with no design to excite feeling&mdash;a
war to propagate wrongs in the Territories thus
acquired from Mexico! It would be a war in which
we should have no sympathies, no good wishes&mdash;in
which all mankind would be against us; for, from the
commencement of the Revolution down to the present
time, we have constantly reproached our British ancestors
for the introduction of slavery into this country."</p>

<p>Mr. Colfax's constituents, extremely satisfied with his
course and abilities, renominated him by acclamation
while he was in Washington this year, and he was
re-elected after the usual joint canvass, although the
presidential election of that fall went against his party.
That such would be the result, Mr. Colfax had confidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
predicted, as a consequence of the third-party
nomination of Mr. Fillmore. But he worked with none
the less zeal for his principles and his party. He had
breadth and soundness and clearness of view enough to
sight along the rising plane of the successive anti-slavery
votes of 1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856, and to see
that the Party of Freedom and Right was the Party
of the Future; and while doubtless he would have
been just as steadfast in doing right if he had no hope
of a right-doing government, yet the very best of men
works with a more cheery strength when, to use the
words of the story, he can "see the chips fly." It
was with sentiments of lofty resolution that he wrote,
some months before the Republican nomination was
made, and just after that of Mr. Fillmore; "Whether
the Republican ticket shall be successful or defeated
this year, the duty to support it, to proclaim and defend
its principles, to arm the conscience of the nation,
is none the less incumbent. The Republican movement
is based on Justice and Right, consecrated to
Freedom, commended by the teachings of our Revolutionary
Fathers, and demanded by the extraordinary
events of our recent history, and though its triumphs
may be delayed, nothing is more certain."</p>

<p>In 1858 Mr. Colfax was again nominated by acclamation,
and re-elected by a triumphant majority, and
so he has been in every election since, carrying his district
against untiring and desperate and enormous efforts
directed against him specially as a representative
man, not merely by his local opponents, but by the
whole forces of every kind which the party opposed
to his could concentrate within his district.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
Such a series of political successes shows not only the
power of the public speaker, and the discretion of the
politician, but shows also a hearty and vigorous unity
of noble thoughts between the constituency and the
representative, and also a magnetic personal attractiveness
which holds fast forever any friend once made.
Mr. Colfax hath friends, because he hath showed himself
friendly.</p>

<p>During the 36th Congress, (December, 1859, to
March, 1861,) Mr. Colfax was chairman of the Committee
on Post Offices and Post Roads, and did much
and useful work in keeping alive and healthy the somewhat
unwieldy machinery of that important institution.
He was in particular, successful in promoting the extension
of mail facilities among the new mining communities
in the Rocky Mountain gold fields, and in
procuring the passage of the very important bills for
the Daily Overland Mail, and for the Overland Telegraph
to San Francisco, by way of Pike's Peak and Utah.</p>

<p>It was a matter of course that Mr. Colfax should go
with all his heart into the great struggle of 1860. He
felt and understood with unusual earnestness and clearness
the importance of the principles involved, and the
hazards of the political campaign. Into a paragraph or
two written some time before the Chicago nomination,
he condensed a whole code of political wisdom, and
can now be seen to have pointed out Abraham Lincoln
as the best candidate, by describing the political
availability and ethical soundness of the position Mr.
Lincoln then occupied. He wrote:</p>

<p>"We differ somewhat from those ardent cotemporaries
who demand the nomination of their favorite representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
man, whether popular or unpopular, and
who insist that this must be done, even if we are defeated.
We do agree with them in declaring that we
shall go for no man who does not prefer free labor and
its extension, to slave labor and its extension,&mdash;who
though mindful of the impartiality which should characterize
the Executive of the whole Union, will not fail
to rebuke all new plots for making the government the
propagandist of slavery, and compel promptly and efficiently
the suppression of that horrible slave-trade
which the whole civilized world has banned as infamous,
piratical and accursed. But in a Republican
National Convention, if any man could be found, North,
South, East or West, whose integrity, whose life, and
whose avowals rendered him unquestionably safe on
these questions, and yet who could yet poll one, two
or three hundred thousand votes more than any one
else, we believe it would be both wisdom and duty,
patriotism and policy, to nominate him by acclamation
and thus render the contest an assured success from
its very opening. We hope to see 1866 realize the
famed motto of Augustine&mdash;"In essentials unity, in
non-essentials liberty, in all things charity."</p>

<p>That is very broad and sound sense. It was in exact
accordance with this doctrine and with these intimations
as to who was the right man, that Mr. Lincoln
was nominated, according to the desire of Mr.
Colfax's heart; and in the coming campaign in his own
very important state of Indiana, he did most valuable
service in assuring the victory.</p>

<p>Upon Mr. Lincoln's election, a very powerful influence,
made up of public sentiment, the efforts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
newspapers, the urgent recommendations of governors
and legislatures, and in particular of the Republican
presidential electors, members of legislature,
congressmen, and whole body of voters of Indiana,
united to press upon the new President the appointment
of Mr. Colfax to the office of Post Master General.
Mr. Lincoln however had resolved to make Hon.
C.&nbsp;B. Smith, of Indiana, Secretary of the Interior,
and could give no other Cabinet place to that State.
But as long as he lived, he loved and respected and
trusted Mr. Colfax; and it is on record that "he rarely
took any steps affecting the interests of the nation
without making his intentions known to Mr. Colfax, in
whose judgment he placed the utmost confidence."</p>

<p>Continuing in Congress, Mr. Colfax served with
efficient and patriotic fervor in his place, and in December,
1863, was chosen, and has since remained
speaker. In this extremely responsible, important and
laborious place, his official career has been openly visible
to all men, while only those among whom he presides
can competently appreciate the rare personal
and acquired qualifications which he has so ably exercised&mdash;the
even good temper, the exhaustless patience,
the calm prompt presence of mind, the immense range
of honest questions and sly quirks of parliamentary
law which he must have at his tongue's end; even
the vigorous health and enduring physical frame which
enable him to sit through session after session, day after
day, without losing his readiness or decisiveness of
thought and action.</p>

<p>He has, however, maintained and even increased his
reputation as a wise and just legislator, a most useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
public servant, a shrewd and kindly chairman, and
a skillful parliamentarian. His duties have not been
in their nature so brilliant as the deeds of our great
commanders by land or by sea; nor so prominent even
as the labors of some civilian officials; but they have
been such as to require the greatest and most solid
and useful of the civic virtues, courage, integrity,
forethought, justice, and steady inexhaustible industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley, in his History of the American Conflict,
gives a survey of the advantages possessed by
the rebels at the commencement of the war, in the
martial character of their leaders. Jefferson Davis
was a regularly educated graduate of West Point, who
had been five years at the head of the War Department
of the United States, and while in that situation had
matured his future plans. He and his successor, Floyd,
up to the year 1861, had arranged the United States
military service to suit themselves, and left it in precisely
the best condition for their designs. "They
knew every officer in the United States service, knew
the military value of each, whom to call away and organize
to lead their own forces, and who, even if loyal,
would serve their purposes better being left in our
armies than taken into theirs."</p>

"On the other hand, President Lincoln, without
military education or experience, found himself suddenly
plunged into a gigantic and to him unexpected
war, with no single member of his cabinet even pretending
to military genius or experience, and with the
offices of his army filled to his hand by the chiefs of
the rebellion. Whereas the whole rebel officers were
enthusiasts who had forsaken all old connections to
join the new army, the officers remaining were some
of them old and feeble, like Scott, and others of that
moderate kind of nature which inclines to remain stationary
with the old institutions, rather than to make
a fiery forward movement. Some two hundred of the
very bravest and most skilful of our army officers went
over to the new cause, to which they carried all the
enthusiasm of youth and hope. Lincoln, in fact, was
in the condition of a man who should be put to a naval
race in an old ship from which his competitors had
taken their pick of all the best sails, spars and hands.</p>

<p>"It is notorious that during the first year or two
of the war, while with every Confederate officer the
rebellion was an enthusiasm and a religion, for which
he was willing at any moment to die, there were on
the Union side many officers, and those of quite high
rank, who seemed to take matters with extreme coolness,
and to have no very particular enthusiasm for
fighting at all. These officers seemed to consider secession
as a great and unlucky mistake&mdash;a mistake,
too, for which they seemed to think the intemperate
zeal of the Black Republicans was particularly in fault,
and their great object seemed to be to conduct the
war with as little fighting as possible, using most conciliatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
language, and always being sure to return
fugitive slaves whenever they could get a good opportunity,
thus apparently expecting in some favorable
hour to terminate hostilities with another of those
grand compromises which had been tried with such
signal success in years past."</p>

<p>The advancement of Stanton to the post of Secretary
of War, was a movement made after it became
somewhat more a settled point than at first appeared,
that war should mean war.</p>

<p>His position during the whole war was, next to that
of the President, the most important, responsible and
influential civil post in the United States, and his services
as an organizer, an administrative and executive
officer, and as a fearless, energetic, resolute, powerful,
and patriotic citizen, were perhaps as nearly indispensable
to the success of the nation in the war as those
of any other one man. Yet the recorded materials
for preparing an account of him are excessively scanty;
far more so than for any of his companions in the
chief offices of Mr. Lincoln's cabinet. This fact is in
a certain sense a very creditable one to him; since it
is the result of his lifelong practice not to talk about
himself, and not to talk about his work, but only to
do it.</p>

<p>Edwin M. Stanton was born at Steubenville, in Ohio,
in the year 1815. His ancestors were of the Quaker
persuasion, as were those of Mr. Lincoln and Attorney
General Bates. His parents removed to Ohio from
Culpepper county, in the mountain region of Virginia.
Stanton received the usual school training of a country
boy, became a student of Kenyon College, in 1833, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
only remained a year and left. This was the end of
his scholastic education. It is easy, to those who
know the decisive, impetuous, self-reliant nature of
the man, and who remember the rough, plain, independent
atmosphere of the backwoods country where
he grew up, to imagine how easily any supposed indignity
from his instructors would drive him out of
their precincts, or how readily he would give up the
idea of further studies as unnecessary, if his supply
of money failed. However this was, he took up an
employment which allowed him to continue some kind
of mental training, for he became a bookseller's clerk
at Columbus. He also studied law, and in 1836 was
admitted to the bar. He first opened an office at Cadiz,
Harrison county, Ohio, and his robust force and
direct sense quickly gave him the best of whatever
practice the country afforded. He became the county
prosecuting attorney in about a year; in another he
had removed to the larger business center of his native
place, Steubenville. His practice rapidly increased,
and during three years from 1839 he was Reporter
of the Ohio Supreme Court decisions. During his
career at Steubenville, he was the counsel of Caleb J.
McNulty, clerk of the House of Representatives, on
his trial for embezzling public money, and cleared
him. This case made a good deal of noise in its day.</p>

<p>In 1848, his business still increasing, Mr. Stanton removed
again, this time to Pittsburg, where he remained
until 1857, becoming without question the first lawyer
at that bar, and beginning to be employed in many of
that important and vigorously contested class of cases
which are carried up to the United States Supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
Court at Washington. One of these, the Wheeling
Bridge case, is perhaps that in which Mr. Stanton
gained his greatest reputation as a lawyer. It is a
curious illustration of his carelessness about his reputation,
that not long ago, when an intimate personal
friend of Mr. Stanton wanted a copy of his argument
in this case to use in a biographical sketch, the Secretary
was unable to furnish it.</p>

<p>In 1857 he removed once more, to Washington,
still following his business. This now began to consist
largely of heavy patent cases, a peculiar and difficult
but very gainful department of legal practice. It
is observable that the class of cases in which Mr.
Stanton has been prominent, are those in which the
executive mental faculties have most to do with the
subject-matter&mdash;patent cases, land cases, vigorous controversies
between great corporations about travelled
routes or conflicting rights. Such cases arise among
executive men, and Mr. Stanton's immense endowment
of executive energy qualified him to succeed easily in
dealing with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton was naturally a Democrat; the vigorous
traits of his character harmonizing spontaneously
with the rough, aggressive energy of the Jacksonians.
Probably his politics may have had some influence in
causing Attorney-General Black to employ him, in
1858, to go to California and argue for the United States
some very important land claim cases there. At any
rate, if he had not been a Democrat, and a thoroughgoing
one, he would not have been selected by Mr.
Buchanan in December, 1860, to succeed Mr. Black as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
Attorney-General, when on Mr. Cass' resignation Mr.
Black became Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The gang of treasonable schemers who were in those
days using their high positions to bind the country
hand and foot, as securely as they could, in preparation
for secession, undoubtedly had reckoned that in
the new Attorney-General, if they did not find an
ally, they would not encounter an obstacle. But his
patriotism was of a very different kind from that of
too many of his party. When the question before
him, instead of being one of high or low tariff, or of one
or another sort of currency, became a question whether
he should go with his party in permitting his country
to be ruined, or should join with all true patriots
irrespective of party considerations, to preserve his
country, he did not hesitate at all. He neither made
allowances for the disreputable fright of old Mr. Buchanan,
nor the far more disreputable schemes of the
traitors who were bullying the feeble and helpless Old
Public Functionary; but stood firmly amongst them
all, a fearless and determined defender of the rights
of the national government.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton once gave a curious and striking sketch
of the manners of Mr. Buchanan's cabinet in those
days. While speaking of the results of Anderson's
move to Sumter, he remarked:</p>

<p>"This little incident was the crisis of our history&mdash;the
pivot upon which everything turned. Had he
remained in Fort Moultrie, a very different combination
of circumstances would have arisen. The attack
on Sumter, commenced by the South, united the
North, and made the success of the Confederacy impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
I shall never forget our coming together by
special summons that night. Buchanan sat in his arm
chair in a corner of the room, white as a sheet, with
the stump of a cigar in his mouth. The dispatches
were laid before us; and so much violence ensued
that he had to turn us all out of doors."</p>

<p>What sort of a scene, and what sort of language
and goings on are covered under that phrase of Mr.
Stanton's, those who are familiar with the manners of
the old Red Dragon of slavery, under moments of excitement,
may imagine. Oaths and curses, threats of
cutting out hearts and tearing out bowels, were usual
amenities, forms of argumentation and statement quite
familiar, on such occasions. Mr. Stanton, as any one
may see by a glance at his head, is one of those men
built on the lion pattern, a man who never knew what
fear was&mdash;a man, also, awful and tremendous in powers
of wrath and combativeness, and we may be sure
at this moment the lion stood at bay, and that his roar
in answer to the dragon's hiss, was something to shake
the cabinet and frighten poor Mr. Buchanan quite out
of his proprieties. We may be sure the traitors did
not go without a full piece of Stanton's mind, stormed
after them with shot and shell, worthy a future Secretary
of the War Department.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton's appointment as Secretary of War was
January 20, 1862; his predecessor, Mr. Cameron, having
resigned a week before. This appointment was
probably in a great measure due to the fresh recollection
of the fearless vigor with which Mr. Stanton, along
with Messrs. Dix and Holt, had asserted the rights of
the nation under Buchanan. Mr. Lincoln, in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
his selection, had the double good fortune of appointing
a man of first-class merit for the position, and one
whose "section" was in the right part of the country.
It is on record that "in answering some questions on
the subject, he observed that his first wish had been
to choose a man from a border state, but that he knew
New England would object; that on the other hand
he would have also been glad to choose a New Englander,
but he knew the Border States would object.
So on the whole he concluded to select from some intervening
territory, 'and to tell you the truth, gentlemen,'
he added, 'I don't believe Stanton knows where he belongs
himself!' Some of the company now said something
about Mr. Stanton's impulsiveness, to which Mr.
Lincoln replied with one of those queer stories with
which he used to answer friends and enemies alike;
'Well,' said he, 'we may have to treat him as they are
sometimes obliged to treat a Methodist minister I know
of out West. He gets wrought up so high in his prayers
and exhortations that they are obliged to put bricks in
his pockets to keep him down. We may be obliged
to serve Stanton the same way, but I guess we'll let
him jump a while first!'"</p>

<p>The existence of the country was bound up in the
war, and it was a matter of course that the War Department
should attract the greatest part of Mr. Lincoln's
solicitude and attention, and that he should be
more frequently and confidentially in intercourse with
its Secretary, than with the other Departments of the
Government. Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Stanton had never
met, it is said, until when the Secretary received his
commission from the President; nor had Mr. Stanton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
any knowledge of the intention to appoint him until
the day before the nomination.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton's Secretaryship is a noble record of
vast energy, untiring labor, thorough patriotism, and
fervent and unfailing courage. Mr. Lincoln, a shrewd
and wise judge of men, knew him familiarly, and
loved and valued him more and more the longer and
closer was their intercourse. Indeed, Mr. Stanton is
probably a man closely shut up and inexpressive of
his good and loveable traits and sentiments, beyond
almost any one living; and it must have required the
whole tremendous pressure and heat of the war, to
soften his iron crust sufficiently to let even the keen
eyed President find out how human and noble a heart
was silently beating inside. The most interesting of
the scanty anecdotes which are in existence about the
Secretary are such as show the unlimited trust which
Mr. Lincoln came to bestow upon him, or the rough
and vigorous utterances by which he customarily revealed
when he revealed at all, anything in the nature
of feelings on his official duties or in reference to the
war. Like many other men of real goodness hidden
beneath a rugged outside, Mr. Stanton's most utterable
sentiment was wrath, and he often, as it were, shot
out a sentiment of goodness inside of a bullet of anger,
as a gruff benefactor might fling a gift at his intended
beneficiary. Such was the "jumping" which Mr. Lincoln
proposed to allow, before keeping down his energetic
Secretary with bricks in his pockets. Such was
the strong figure in which one day he conveyed to a
brother Secretary his views on the fitness of appointees.
Mr. Usher, when Secretary of the Interior, once asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
Mr. Stanton to appoint a "young friend," paymaster in
the army. "How old is he?" asked Stanton, in his
curt manner. "About twenty-one, I believe," said
Mr. Usher; "he is of good family and of excellent
character." "Usher," exclaimed Mr. Stanton, in peremptory
reply, "I would not appoint the Angel Gabriel
a paymaster if he was only twenty-one!"</p>

<p>There was just as much unceremoniousness, and
even very much more peremptory force and earnestness
in the vigorous rebuke which Mr. Stanton administered
to Mr. Lincoln on the night of March 30, 1865,
for the unseasonable favors which he was inclined to
offer to the rebels, to the detriment of justice and of
the paramount rights of the nation. On this occasion,
while the last bills of the session were under examination
for signing, and while the President and all with
him were enjoying the expectation of to-morrow's inauguration,
a dispatch came in from Grant, which
stated his confidence that a few days must now end
the business with Lee and Richmond, and spoke of an
application made by Lee for an interview to negotiate
about peace. Mr. Lincoln intimated pretty clearly an
intention to permit extremely favorable terms, and to
let his General-in-Chief negotiate them; even to an
extent that overpowered the reticent habits of his
Secretary of War, who, after holding his tongue as
long as he could, broke out sternly:</p>

<p>"Mr. President, to-morrow is inauguration day. If
you are not to be the President of an obedient and
united people, <i>you had better not be inaugurated</i>. Your
work is already done, if any other authority than
yours is for one moment to be recognized, or any terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
made that do not signify that you are the supreme
head of the nation. If generals in the field are to negotiate
peace, or any other chief magistrate is to be
acknowledged on this continent, <i>then you are not needed
and you had better not take the oath of office</i>."</p>

<p>"Stanton, you are right," said the President, his
whole tone changing. "Let me have a pen."</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln sat down at the table, and wrote as
follows:</p>

<p>"The President directs me to say to you that he
wishes you to have no conference with General Lee,
unless it be for the capitulation of Lee's army, or on
some minor or purely military matter. He instructs
me to say that you are not to decide, discuss, or confer
upon any political question; such questions the President
holds in his own hands, and will submit them to no
military conference or conventions. In the mean time
you are to press to the utmost your military advantages."</p>

<p>The President then read over what he had written,
and then said:</p>

<p>"Now Stanton, date and sign this paper, and send
it to Grant. We'll see about this peace business."</p>

<p>An account which appeared in a Cincinnati paper
during the war, of a curious transaction at Washington,
shows that Mr. Lincoln was as steady in trusting
to Mr. Stanton's own wisdom in action, as he was
ready to acknowledge the justice of the Secretary's
reproofs on a question of constitutional propriety.
This account is as follows:</p>

<p>"While the President was on his way back from
Richmond, and at a point where no telegraph could
reach the steamer upon which he was, a dispatch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
the utmost importance reached Washington, demanding
the immediate decision of the President himself.
The dispatch was received by a confidential staff officer,
who at once ascertained that Mr. Lincoln could not be
reached. Delay was out of the question, as important
army movements were involved. The officer having
the dispatch went with it directly to Mr. Stanton's
office, but the Secretary could not be found. Messengers
were hastily dispatched for him in all directions.
Their search was useless, and a positive answer had been
already too much delayed by the time it had occupied.
With great reluctance the staff officer sent a reply in
the President's name. Soon after, Mr. Stanton entered
himself, having learned of the efforts made to find him.
The dispatch was produced, and he was informed by
the officer sending the answer, of what had been done.</p>

<p>"'Did I do right?' said the officer to the Secretary.</p>

<p>"'Yes, Major,' replied Mr. Stanton, 'I think you
have sent the correct reply, but I should hardly have
dared to take the responsibility.'</p>

<p>"At this the whole magnitude of the office and the
great responsibility he had taken upon himself, seemed
to fall upon the officer, and almost overcame him; and
he asked Mr. Stanton what he had better do, and was
advised to go directly to the President, on his return,
and state the case frankly to him. It was a sleepless
night to the officer, and at the very earliest hour consistent
with propriety he went to the White House."</p>

<p>Here the officer, scarcely even by the accidental interposition
of the President's son, was able to reach
him, as there were strict orders for his privacy just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
then. At last, he entered the President's room, and,
the story continues,</p>

<p>"The dispatch was shown him, and the action upon
it stated frankly and briefly. The President thought
a moment and then said, 'Did you consult the Secretary
of War, Major?' The absence of the Secretary
at the important moment was then related to Mr. Lincoln,
with the subsequent remark of Mr. Stanton, that
he thought the right answer had been given, but that
himself would have shrunk from the responsibility.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lincoln, on hearing the story, rose, crossed the
room, and taking the officer by the hand, thanked him
cordially, and then spoke of Mr. Stanton as follows:</p>

<p>"'Hereafter, Major, when you have Mr. Stanton's
sanction in any matter, you have mine, for so great is
my confidence in his judgment and patriotism, that I
never wish to take an important step myself without
first consulting him.'"</p>

<p>Only a few days before his death, Mr. Lincoln gave
a still more striking testimony of the affectionate nature
of his regard for Mr. Stanton. This was when
Mr. Stanton tendered him his resignation of the War
Department, on the ground that the work for whose
sake he had taken it, was now done.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lincoln," says a witness, "was greatly moved
by the Secretary's words, and tearing in pieces the
paper containing the resignation, and throwing his
arms about the Secretary, he said, 'Stanton, you have
been a good friend and a faithful public servant, and
it is not for you to say when you will no longer be
needed here.' Several friends of both parties were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
present on this occasion, and there was not a dry eye
that witnessed the scene."</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton occupied a situation of torturing responsibility
and distracting cares. He bore burdens
of perplexity and doubt and apprehension such as
might tax the stoutest nerves. His only mode of
meeting and repelling the dashing waves of hourly solicitations
and the thousand agencies which beset a man
in his position, was to make himself externally as rugged
and stern as a rock.</p>

<p>But those who knew him intimately, as did Lincoln,
and as did many others who were drawn towards him,
interiorly, during the wrench of the great struggle,
knew that deep within there was a heart, warm, kind,
true and humbly religious&mdash;deeply feeling his responsibilities
to God, and seeking with honest purpose to
fulfil his duties in the awful straits in which he was
placed. To a lady for whom he had performed in the
way of his office some kindness, and who expressed
gratitude, he writes:</p>

<p>"In respect to the matter in which you feel a personal
interest and refer to with kind expressions of
gratitude towards myself, I am glad that in the discharge
of simple duty I have been able to relieve an anxious
care in the heart of any one, and much more in the
hearts of persons, who although personally unknown
to me, I have been accustomed from early youth to
reverence.</p>

<p>"In my official station I have tried to do my duty as
I shall answer to God at the Great Day, but it is the
misfortune of that station&mdash;a misfortune that no one
else can comprehend the magnitude of, that most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
my duties are harsh and painful to some one, so that I
rejoice at an opportunity, however rare, of combining
duty with kindly offices."</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what further services, if any,
Mr. Stanton will render to his country in a public capacity.
Should he again be a public servant, it will
be as it has been, the United States, and not he, who
will be the obliged party.</p>

<p>The reader will perceive, in reading the memoirs
which we have collected in the present volume, that
although they give a few instances of men who have
risen to distinction from comfortable worldly circumstances,
by making a good use of the provision afforded
them by early competence and leisure, yet by far
the greater number have raised themselves by their
own unaided efforts, in spite of every disadvantage
which circumstances could throw in their way.</p>

<p>It is the pride and the boast of truly republican institutions
that they give to every human being an opportunity
of thus demonstrating what is in him. If a
man is a man, no matter in what rank of society he is
born, no matter how tied down and weighted by poverty
and all its attendant disadvantages, there is nothing
in our American institutions to prevent his rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
to the very highest offices in the gift of the country.
So, though a man like Charles Sumner, coming of an
old Boston family, with every advantage of Boston
schools and of Cambridge college, becomes distinguished
through the country, yet side by side with
him we see Abraham Lincoln, the rail splitter, Henry
Wilson, from the shoemaker's bench, and Chase, from
a New Hampshire farm. But there have been in our
country some three or four million of human beings
who were born to a depth of poverty below what
Henry Wilson or Abraham Lincoln ever dreamed of.
Wilson and Lincoln, to begin with, owned nothing
but their bare hands, but there have been in this country
four or five million men and women who did not
own even their bare hands. Wilson and Lincoln, and
other brave men like them, owned their own souls
and wills&mdash;they were free to say, "Thus and thus I
will do&mdash;I will be educated, I will be intelligent, I
will be Christian, I will by honest industry amass property
to serve me in my upward aims." But there were
four million men and women in America who were
decreed by the laws of this country not to own even
their own souls. The law said of them&mdash;They shall
be taken and held as chattels personal to all intents
and purposes. This hapless class of human beings
might be sold for debt, might be mortgaged for real
estate, nay, the unborn babe might be pledged or
mortgaged for the debts of a master. There were
among these unfortunate millions, in the eye of the
law, neither husbands nor wives, nor fathers nor mothers;
they were only chattels personal. They could no
more contract a legal marriage than a bedstead can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
marry a cooking-stove, or a plough be wedded to a
spinning wheel. They were week after week advertised
in public prints to be sold in company with
horses, cows, pigs, hens, and other stock of a plantation.</p>

<p>They were forbidden to learn to read. The slave
laws imposed the same penalty on the man who should
teach a slave to read as on the man who wilfully put
out his eyes. They had no legal right to be Christians,
or enter the kingdom of heaven, because the law regarded
them simply as personal property, subject to
the caprice of an owner, and when the owner did not
choose to have his property be a Christian, he could
shut him out from the light of the gospel as easily as
one can close a window shutter.</p>

<p>Now if we think it a great thing that Wilson and
Lincoln raised themselves from a state of comparatively
early disadvantage to high places in the land, what
shall we think of one who started from this immeasureable
gulf below them?</p>

<p>Frederick Douglass had as far to climb to get to the
spot where the poorest free white boy is born, as that
white boy has to climb to be president of the nation,
and take rank with kings and judges of the earth.</p>

<p>There are few young men born to competence, carried
carefully through all the earlier stages of training,
drilled in grammar school, and perfected by a
four years' college course, who could stand up on a
platform and compete successfully with Frederick
Douglass as an orator. Nine out of ten of college educated
young men would shrink even from the trial,
and yet Frederick Douglass fought his way up from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
nameless hovel on a Maryland plantation, where with
hundreds of others of the young live stock he shivered
in his little tow shirt, the only garment allowed him
for summer and winter, kept himself warm by sitting
on the sunny side of out buildings, like a little dog,
and often was glad to dispute with the pigs for the
scraps of what came to them to satisfy his hunger.</p>

<p>From this position he has raised himself to the habits
of mind, thought and life of a cultivated gentleman,
and from that point of sight has illustrated exactly
what slavery WAS, (thank God we write in the
past tense,) in an autobiography which most affectingly
presents what it is to be born a slave. Every man
who struck a stroke in our late great struggle&mdash;every
man or woman who made a sacrifice for it&mdash;every one
conscious of inward bleedings and cravings that never
shall be healed or assuaged, for what they have rendered
up in this great anguish, ought to read this autobiography
of a slave man, and give thanks to God
that even by the bitterest sufferings they have been
permitted to do something to wipe such a disgrace
and wrong from the earth.</p>

<p>The first thing that every man remembers is his
mother. Americans all have a mother at least that
can be named. But it is exceedingly affecting to read
the history of a human being who writes that during
all his childhood he never saw his mother more than
two or three times, and then only in the night. And
why? Because she was employed on a plantation
twelve miles away. Her only means of seeing her
boy were to walk twelve miles over to the place where
he was, spend a brief hour, and walk twelve miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
back, so as to be ready to go to work at four
o'clock in the morning. How many mothers would
often visit their children by such an effort? and yet
at well remembered intervals the mother of Frederick
Douglass did this for the sake of holding her child a
little while in her arms, lying down a brief hour with
him.</p>

<p>That she was a woman of uncommon energy and
strength of affection this sufficiently shows, because as
slave mother she could do him no earthly good&mdash;she
owned not a cent to bring him. She could not buy
him clothes. She could not even mend or wash the
one garment allotted to him.</p>

<p>Only once in his childhood did he remember his
mother's presence as being to him anything of that
comfort and protection that it is to ordinary children.
He, with all the other little live stock of the plantation,
were dependent for a daily allowance of food on
a cross old woman whom they called Aunt Katy. For
some reason of her own, Aunt Katy had taken a pique
against little Fred, and announced to him that she was
going to keep him a day without food. At the close
of this day, when he crept shivering in among the
other children, and was denied even the coarse slice
of corn bread which all the rest had, he broke out
into loud lamentations. Suddenly his mother appeared
behind him&mdash;caught him in her arms, poured out
volumes of wrathful indignation on Aunt Katy, and
threatened to complain to the overseer if she did not
give him his share of food&mdash;produced from her bosom
a sweet cake which she had managed to procure for
him, and sat down to wipe away his tears and see him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
enjoy it. This mother must have been a woman of
strong mental characteristics. Though a plantation
field hand, she could read, and if we consider against
what superhuman difficulties such a knowledge must
have been acquired, it is an evidence of wonderful
character. Douglass says of her that she was tall and
finely proportioned. With affecting simplicity he
says: "There is in Pritchard's Natural History of Man,
p. 157, the head of a figure the features of which so
resemble those of my mother, that I often recur to it
with something of the feeling which I suppose others
to experience when looking on the pictures of dear
departed ones."</p>

<p>The face alluded to is copied from a head of Rameses
the great Egyptian king of the nineteenth dynasty.
The profile is European in its features, and similar in
class to the head of Napoleon. From all these considerations,
we have supposed that the mother of
Douglass must have been one of that Mandingo tribe
of Africans who were distinguished among the slaves
for fine features, great energy, intelligence and pride
of character. The black population of America is
not one race. If slaveholders and kidnappers had been
busy for years in Europe stirring up wars in the different
countries, and sending all the captives to be sold in
America, the mixture of Swedes, Danes, Germans,
Russians, Italians, French, might all have gone under
the one head of <i>Whitemen</i>, but they would have been
none the more of the same race. The negroes of this
country are a mixture torn from tribes and races quite
as dissimilar. The Mandingo has European features,
a fine form, wavy, not woolly hair, is intelligent, vigorous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
proud and brave. The Guinea negro has
a coarse, animal head, is stupid, dirty, cunning. Yet
the argument on <i>negro</i> powers is generally based on
some such sweeping classification as takes the Guinea
negro for its type.</p>

<p>The father of Frederick Douglass was a white man,
who, he never knew&mdash;it would have been of no advantage
to him had he known&mdash;but there is reason to
think that those fine intellectual gifts, that love of liberty,
and hatred of slavery which have led him to the
position he now occupies among freemen, were due to
the blood of his mother. That silent, noble black
woman, whose wrongs were borne in such patience,
whose soul must so often have burned within her, whose
affections were stronger than weariness, and whose
mind <i>would</i> possess the key of knowledge even though
she gained it at such terrible sacrifices and hazards,
she is to be honored as the mother of Garrison is, as
having lived in her son and being the true author and
inspirer of all that is good and just in him.</p>

<p>After a few short interviews the communication between
Douglass and his mother ceased. She was taken
sick, had a long illness and died without a word or
message, or any token passing between her and her
child. He running wild, a dirty little animal on the
distant plantation, she suffering, wasting, dying in silence&mdash;going
into the great Invisible where so many
helpless mothers have gone to plead for their children
before God.</p>

<p>The plantation of Col. Loyd, on which Fred Douglass
was raised, was a representative fact illustrating
what may be known of slavery. <i>There</i> might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
seen a large airy elegant house, filled with every luxury
and comfort, the abode of hospitality and leisure.
Company always coming and going&mdash;bountiful tables
spread with every delicacy of sea and land&mdash;choice
cookery, old wines, massive plate, splendid curtains
and pictures, all combined to give the impression of a
joyous and abundant life. Fifteen well dressed, well
trained servants, chosen for good looks and good manners,
formed an obsequious army of attendants behind
the chairs of guests at the dinner hour, or waited on
them in their private apartments.</p>

<p>The shrubbery, the flower gardens, the ample lawns,
were laid out with European taste, the stables had
studs of the finest blood horses at the disposal
of guests&mdash;all was cultivation, elegance and refinement.</p>

<p>Col. Loyd was supposed to own a thousand slaves,
and what the life was on which all this luxury and elegance
was built, the history of Douglass and his mother
may show. Col. Loyd owned several contiguous farms
or plantations, each one under an overseer, and all
were under the general supervision of an agent who
lived on the central plantation and went by the name
among the slaves of Old Master. Between this man
and his family, and Col. Loyd and his family, there was
none of the intercourse of equals. No visits were ever
exchanged, and no intercourse except of a necessary
business character ever took place. The owner and
his family had nothing to do with the management of
the estates any further than to enjoy and dispense the
revenues they brought; in all the rest was left to "Old
Master and the Overseers." The estate was as secluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
from all influence of public opinion, and the slaves
were as completely in the power of the overseers, as
the serfs in the feudal ages. Even the vessels which
carried the produce of the plantation to Baltimore,
were owned by Col. Loyd. Every man and boy by
whom these vessels were worked, excepting the captains,
were Col. Loyd's property. All the artizans on
all the places, the blacksmiths, wheelwrights, shoe makers,
weavers and coopers, also were pieces of property
belonging to Col. Loyd. What chance was there for
laws or for public sentiment, or any other humanizing
influence, to restrain absolute power in a district so
governed?</p>

<p>One of the earliest lessons in the practical meaning
of slavery was taught to the child by hearing the
shrieks and groans of a favorite Aunt Esther, under
the lash of Old Master. She was a finely formed, handsome
woman, and had the presumption to prefer a
young slave man to her master, and for this she was
made the victim of degradation and torture.</p>

<p>On another occasion he saw a young girl who came
from one of the neighboring plantations, with her head
cut and bleeding from the brutality of the overseer,
to put herself under the protection of Old Master.
Though the brutality of her treatment was perfectly
evident, he heard her met only with reproaches and
oaths and ordered to go back at once or expect even
severer treatment. This was a part of an unvarying
system. It was a fixed rule, never to listen to complaints
of any kind from a slave, and even when they
were evidently well founded, to affect to disregard
them. That the slave was to have no appeal in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
case from the absolute power of the overseer, was a
fundamental maxim of the system.</p>

<p>Endowed by his mother with an intelligent and
thoughtful organization, young Douglass began early
to turn in his mind the dark question, "<i>Why am I a
slave?</i>" On this subject he pushed enquiries among
his little play-fellows and the elderly negroes, but could
get no satisfactory solution, except that some remembered
that their fathers and mothers were stolen from
Africa. When not more than seven or eight years old
these thoughts burned in him, whenever he wandered
through the woods and fields, and a strong determination
to become a freeman in future life took possession
of him. It may have been inspired by the invisible
guardianship of that poor mother, who, unable to
help him in life, may have been permitted higher powers
in the world of spirits.</p>

<p>The comments which Douglass makes on many features
of slave life, as they affected his childish mind,
are very peculiar, and show slavery entirely from an
inside point of view.</p>

<p>In regard to the physical comforts of plantation life,
he gives the following account:</p>

<p>"It is the boast of slaveholders that their slaves enjoy
more of the physical comforts of life than the peasantry
of any country in the world. My experience contradicts
this. The men and the women slaves on Col.
Loyd's plantation received as their monthly allowance,
eight pounds of pickled pork or their equivalent in
fish. The pork was often tainted and the fish of the
poorest quality. With this, they had one bushel of
unbolted Indian meal, of which quite fifteen per cent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
was fit only for pigs; with this one pint of salt was
given, and this was the entire monthly allowance of a
full grown slave, working constantly in the open field,
from morning till night, every day of the month, except
Sundays. This was living on a fraction more
than a quarter of a pound of poor meat per day, and
less than a peck of corn meal per week, and there is
no work requiring more abundant supply of food to
prevent physical exhaustion, than the field work of a
slave.</p>

<p>"So much for food. Now as for raiment. The yearly
allowance of clothing for slaves on this plantation,
consisted of two linen shirts, one pair of tow trowsers for
summer, a pair of trowsers and jacket of slazy workmanship
for winter, one pair of yarn stockings, and
one pair of coarse shoes. The slave's entire apparel
could not have cost more than eight dollars a year.
Children not yet able to work in the field had neither
shoes, stockings, jackets or trowsers given them.
Their clothing consisted of two coarse tow linen shirts
per year, and when these failed, they went literally
naked till next allowance day. Flocks of children
from five to ten years old might be seen on Col. Loyd's
plantations as destitute of clothing as any little heathen
in Africa and this even in the frosty month of March.</p>

<p>"As to beds to sleep on, none were given&mdash;nothing
but a coarse blanket, such as is used in the North to
cover horses&mdash;and these were not provided for little
ones.</p>

<p>"The children cuddled in holes and corners about the
quarters, often in the corners of the huge chimneys
with their feet in the ashes to keep them warm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
An average day of plantation life is thus given:</p>

<p>"Old and young, male and female, married and single,
drop down together on the clay floor of the cabin
each evening with his or her blanket. The night however
is shortened at both ends. The slaves work often
as long as they can see, and are late in cooking and
mending for the coming day, and at the first grey
streak of morning are summoned to the field by the
driver's horn.</p>

<p>"More slaves are whipped for oversleeping than for
any other fault. The overseer stands at the quarter
door, armed with his cowhide, ready to whip any who
may be a few minutes behind time. When the horn
is blown, there is a rush for the door, and the hindermost
one is sure to get a blow from the overseer.
Young mothers working in the field were allowed about
ten o'clock to go home and nurse their children. Sometimes
they are obliged to take their children with them
and leave them in the corners of the fences, to prevent
loss of time. The overseer rides round the field
on horseback. A cowskin and a hickory stick are his
constant companions. The slaves take their breakfast
with them and eat it in the field. The dinner of the
slave consists of a huge piece of ash cake, that is to
say, unbolted corn meal and water, stirred up and
baked in the ashes. To this a small slice of pork or a
couple of salt herring were added. A few moments
of rest is allowed at dinner, which is variously spent.
Some lie down on the "turning row" and go to sleep.
Others draw together and talk, others are at work
with needle and thread mending their tattered garments;
but soon the overseer comes dashing in upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
them. Tumble up&mdash;tumble up is the word, and now
from twelve o'clock till dark, the human cattle are in
motion, wielding their clumsy hoes, inspired by no
hope of reward, no sense of gratitude, no love of children,
no prospect of bettering their condition, nothing
save the dread and terror of the driver's lash. So
goes one day and so comes another." This is slavery
as remembered by a cultivated, intelligent man who
was born and bred a slave.</p>

<p>In regard to his own peculiar lot as a child on this
plantation, he says: "I was seldom whipped, and
never severely, by my old master. I suffered little
from any treatment I received, except from hunger
and cold. I could get enough neither of food or
clothing, but suffered more from cold than hunger.
In the heat of summer or cold of winter alike I was
kept almost in a state of nudity&mdash;no shoes, stockings,
jacket, trowsers&mdash;nothing but a coarse tow linen shirt
reaching to the knee. This I wore night and day. In
the daytime I could protect myself pretty well by keeping
on the sunny side of the house, and in bad weather
in the corner of the kitchen chimney. The great
difficulty was to keep warm at night. I had no bed.
The pigs in the pen had leaves, and horses in the stable
had straw, but the children had nothing. In very
cold weather I sometimes got down the bag in which
corn was carried to the mill, and got into that. My
feet have been so cracked by the frost that the pen
with which I am writing might be laid in the gashes.</p>

<p>"The manner of taking our meals at old master's,
indicated but little refinement. Our corn-meal mush,
when sufficiently cooled, was placed in a large wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
tray, or trough, like those used in making maple sugar
here in the north. This tray was set down, either on
the floor of the kitchen or out of doors on the ground;
and the children were called, like so many pigs; and
like so many pigs they would come, and literally devour
the mush&mdash;some with oyster shells, some with
pieces of shingles, and none with spoons. He that
ate fastest got most, and he that was strongest got the
best place; and few left the trough really satisfied. I
was the most unlucky of any, for Aunt Katy had no
good feeling for me; and if I pushed any of the other
children, or if they told her anything unfavorable of
me, she always believed the worst, and was sure to
whip me."</p>

<p>The effect of all this on his childish mind is thus
told:</p>

<p>"As I grew older and more thoughtful, I was more
and more filled with a sense of my wretchedness. The
cruelty of Aunt Katy, the hunger and cold I suffered,
and the terrible reports of wrong and outrage which
came to my ear, together with what I almost daily
witnessed, led me, when yet but eight or nine years
old, to wish I had never been born. I used to contrast
my condition with the blackbirds, in whose wild
and sweet songs I fancied them so happy! Their apparent
joy only deepened the shades of my sorrow.
There are thoughtful days in the lives of children&mdash;at
least there were in mine&mdash;when they grapple with all
the great primary subjects of knowledge, and reach
in a moment, conclusions which no subsequent experience
can shake. I was just as well aware of the unjust,
unnatural, and murderous character of slavery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
when nine years old, as I am now. Without any appeal
to books, to laws, or to authorities of any kind,
it was enough to accept God as a father, to regard
slavery as a crime."</p>

<p>Douglass' remarks on the singing of slaves are very
striking. Speaking of certain days of each month
when the slaves from the different farms came up to
the central plantation to get their monthly allowances
of meal and meat, he says that there was always great
contention among the slaves as to who should go up
with the ox team for this purpose. He says:</p>

<p>"Probably the chief motive of the competitors for
the place, was a desire to break the dull monotony
of the field, and to get beyond the overseer's eye
and lash. Once on the road with an ox team, and
seated on the tongue of his cart, with no overseer
to look after him, the slave was comparatively free;
and, if thoughtful, he had time to think. Slaves are
generally expected to sing as well as to work. A silent
slave is not liked by masters or overseers. '<i>Make
a noise</i>,' '<i>make a noise</i>,' and '<i>bear a hand</i>,' are the
words usually addressed to the slaves when there is
silence amongst them. This may account for the almost
constant singing heard in the southern states.
There was generally more or less singing among the
teamsters, as it was one means of letting the overseer
know where they were, and that they were moving
on with the work. But on allowance day, those who
visited the great house farm were peculiarly excited
and noisy. While on their way, they would make the
dense old woods, for miles around, reverberate with
their wild notes. These were not always merry because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
they were wild. On the contrary, they were
mostly of a plaintive cast, and told a tale of grief and
sorrow. In the most boisterous outbursts of rapturous
sentiment, there was ever a tinge of deep melancholy.
I have never heard any songs like those anywhere
since I left slavery, except when in Ireland.
There I heard the same <i>wailing notes</i>, and was much
affected by them. It was during the famine of 1845&ndash;6.
In all the songs of the slaves there was ever
some expression in praise of the great house farm;
something which would flatter the pride of the owner
and possibly, draw a favorable glance from him.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am going away to the great house farm,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">O yea! O yea! O yea!<br /></span>

<span class="i6">O yea! O yea! O yea!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"I did not, when a slave, understand the deep
meanings of those rude, and apparently incoherent
songs. I was myself within the circle, so that I neither
saw nor heard as those without might see and hear.
They told a tale which was then altogether beyond
my feeble comprehension; they were tones, loud,
long and deep, breathing the prayer and complaint of
souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every
tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to
God for deliverance from chains. The hearing of
those wild notes always depressed my spirits, and filled
my heart with ineffable sadness. The mere recurrence,
even now, afflicts my spirit, and while I am
writing these lines, my tears are falling. To those
songs I trace my first glimmering conceptions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get
rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me,
to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies
for my brethren in bonds."</p>

<p>When Douglass was ten years old a great change
took place in his circumstances. His old master sent
him to Baltimore to be a family servant in the house
of a family connection.</p>

<p>He speaks with great affection of his new mistress,
Miss Sophia Auld. It is the southern custom for the
slave to address a young married lady always by this
maiden title. She had never before had to do with
a slave child, and seemed to approach him with all the
tender feelings of motherhood. He was to have the
care of her own little son, some years younger, and
she seemed to extend maternal tenderness to him.
His clothing, lodging, food were all now those of a
favored house boy, and his employment to run of errands
and take care of his little charge, of whom he
was very fond. The kindness and benignity of his
mistress led the little boy to beg her to teach him to
read, and the results are thus given:</p>

<p>"The dear woman began the task, and very soon,
by her assistance, I was master of the alphabet, and
could spell words of three or four letters. My mistress
seemed almost as proud of my progress, as if I
had been her own child; and supposing that her husband
would be as well pleased, she made no secret of
what she was doing for me. Indeed, she exultingly
told him of the aptness of her pupil, of her intention
to persevere in teaching me, and of the duty which
she felt it to teach me at least to read <i>the Bible</i>. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
arose the first cloud over my Baltimore prospects, the
precursor of drenching rains and chilling blasts.</p>

<p>"Master Hugh was amazed at the simplicity of his
spouse, and probably for the first time, he unfolded to
her the true philosophy of slavery, and the peculiar
rules necessary to be observed by masters and mistresses,
in the management of their human chattels.
Mr. Auld promptly forbade the continuance of her instruction;
telling her, in the first place, that the thing
itself was unlawful; that it was also unsafe, and could
only lead to mischief. To use his own words, further,
he said, 'If you give a nigger an inch, he will take
an ell; he should know nothing but the will of his
master, and learn to obey it. Learning would spoil
the best nigger in the world; if you teach that nigger'&mdash;speaking
of myself&mdash;'how to read the Bible, there
will be no keeping him; it would forever unfit him
for the duties of a slave, and as to himself, learning
would do him no good, but probably a great deal of
harm&mdash;making him disconsolate and unhappy. If
you learn him now to read, he'll want to know how
to write; and this accomplished, he'll be running away
with himself.' Such was the tenor of Master Hugh's
oracular exposition of the true philosophy of training
a human chattel; and it must be confessed that he
very clearly comprehended the nature and the requirements
of the relation of master and slave. His discourse
was the first decidedly anti-slavery lecture to
which it had been my lot to listen. Mrs. Auld evidently
felt the force of his remarks; and, like an obedient
wife, began to shape her course in the direction
indicated by her husband. The effect of his words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
<i>on me</i> was neither slight nor transitory. His iron sentences,
cold and harsh, sunk deep into my heart, and
stirred up not only my feelings into a sort of rebellion,
but awakened within me a slumbering train of vital
thought. It was a new and special revelation, dispelling
a painful mystery, against which my youthful understanding
had struggled, and struggled in vain, to
wit: the <i>white</i> man's power to perpetuate the enslavement
of the <i>black</i> man. 'Very well,' thought I,
'knowledge unfits a child to be a slave.' I instinctively
assented to the proposition; and from that moment
I understood the direct pathway from slavery to
freedom."</p>

<p>But the desire of learning, once awakened, could not
be hushed, and though Douglass' mistress forebore his
teaching, and even became jealously anxious to prevent
his making further progress, he found means to
continue the instruction. With a spelling-book hid
away in his bosom, and a few crackers in his pocket,
he continued to get daily lessons from the street boys
at intervals when he went back and forth on errands.
Sometimes the tuition fee was a cracker, and sometimes
the lesson was given in mere boyish good will. At
last he made money enough to buy for himself, secretly,
a reading book, "The Columbian Orator." This
book was prepared for schools during the liberty-loving
era succeeding the American revolution, when southern
as well as northern men conspired to reprobate
slavery. There consequently young Fred found most
inspiring documents. There was a long conversation
between a master and a slave where a slave defended
himself for running away by quoting the language of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
the Declaration of Independence. Douglass also says
of this book:</p>

<p>"This, however, was not all the fanaticism which I
found in this Columbian Orator. I met there one of
Sheridan's mighty speeches on the subject of Catholic
Emancipation, Lord Chatham's speech on the American
war, and speeches by the great William Pitt and
by Fox. These were all choice documents to me, and
I read them over and over again, with an interest that
was ever increasing, because it was ever gaining in
intelligence; for the more I read them the better I
understood them. The reading of these speeches added
much to my limited stock of language, and enabled
me to give tongue to many interesting thoughts,
which had frequently flashed through my soul, and
died away for want of utterance."</p>

<p>All this knowledge and expansion of mind, of
course produced at first intellectual gloom and misery.
All the results of learning to read, predicted by
the master, had come to pass. He was so morose, so
changed, that his mistress noticed it, and showered reproaches
upon him for his ingratitude. "Poor lady,"
he says, "she did not know my trouble and I dared
not tell her&mdash;her abuse felt like the blows of Balaam
on his poor ass, she did not know that an <i>angel</i> stood
in the way."</p>

<p>"My feelings were not the result of any marked cruelty
in the treatment I received; they sprung from the
consideration of my being a slave at all. It was <i>slavery</i>&mdash;not
its mere <i>incidents</i>&mdash;that I hated. I had been
cheated. I saw through the attempt to keep me in
ignorance; I saw that slaveholders would have gladly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
made me believe that they were merely acting under
the authority of God, in making a slave of me, and
in making slaves of others; and I treated them as robbers
and deceivers. The feeding and clothing me well,
could not atone for taking my liberty from me."</p>

<p>About this time Douglass became deeply awakened
to religious things, by the prayers and exhortations of
a pious old colored slave who was a drayman. He
could read and his friend could not, but Douglass, now
newly awakened to spiritual things, read the Bible to
him, and received comfort from him. He says, "He
fanned my already intense love of knowledge into a
flame by assuring me that I was to be a useful man in
the world. When I would say to him, how can these
things be, his simple reply was, '<i>trust in the Lord</i>.'
When I told him that I was a <i>slave</i> <span class="smcap smaller">FOR LIFE</span>, he said:
'The Lord can make you free, my dear. All things
are possible with him, only have faith in God. If
you want your liberty, ask the Lord for it in faith, and
<span class="smcap smaller">HE WILL GIVE IT TO YOU</span>.'" Cheered by this advice, Douglass
began to offer daily and earnest prayers for liberty.</p>

<p>With reference to this he began to turn his thoughts
towards acquiring the art of writing. He was employed
as waiter in a ship yard, and watching the initial
letters by which the carpenters marked the different
parts of the ship, and thus in time acquired a
large part of the written alphabet. This knowledge
he supplemented by getting one and another boy of
his acquaintance on one pretence or other, to write
words or letters on fences or boards. Then he surreptitiously
copied the examples in his little master's copy-book
at home, when his mistress was safely out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
house, and finally acquired the dangerous and forbidden
gift of writing a fluent, handsome current hand.</p>

<p>He had various reverses after this as he grew in age
and developed in manliness. He was found difficult
to manage, and changed from hand to hand like a vicious
intractable horse. Once a celebrated negro
breaker had a hand upon him, meaning to break his
will and reduce him to the condition of a contented
animal, but the old story of Pegasus in harness came
to pass. The negro breaker gave him up as a bad
case, and finally his master made a virtue of necessity,
and allowed him to hire his own time. The bargain
was that Douglass should pay him three dollars a week,
and make his own bargains, find his own tools, board
and clothe himself. The work was that of caulker in
a ship yard. This, he says, was a hard bargain; for the
wear and tear of clothing, the breakage of tools and
expenses of board made it necessary to earn at least
six dollars a week, to keep even with the world, and
this per centage to the master left him nothing beyond
a bare living.</p>

<p>But it was a freeman's experience to be able to come
and go unwatched, and before long it enabled him to
mature a plan of escape, and the time at last came
when he found himself a free colored citizen of New
Bedford, seeking employment, with the privilege of
keeping his wages for himself. Here, it was that reading
for the first time the Lady of the Lake, he gave
himself the name of Douglass, and abandoned forever
the family name of his old slaveholding employer.
Instead of a lazy thriftless young man to be supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
by his earnings, he took unto himself an affectionate
and thrifty wife, and became a settled family man.</p>

<p>He describes the seeking for freeman's work as rapturous
excitement. The thought "I can work, I can
earn money, I have no master now to rob me of my
earnings," was a perfect joyous stimulus whenever it
arose, and he says, "I sawed wood, dug cellars, shoveled
coal, rolled oil casks on the wharves, helped to
load and unload vessels, worked in candle works and
brass foundries, and thus supported myself for three
years. I was, he says, now living in a new world, and
wide awake to its advantages. I early began to attend
meetings of the colored people, in New Bedford,
and to take part in them, and was amazed to see
colored men making speeches, drawing up resolutions,
and offering them for consideration."</p>

<p>His enthusiasm for self-education was constantly stimulated.
He appropriated some of his first earnings to
subscribing for the Liberator, and was soon after introduced
to Mr. Garrison. How Garrison appeared to a
liberated slave may be a picture worth preserving,
and we give it in Douglass' own words.</p>

<p>"Seventeen years ago, few men possessed a more
heavenly countenance than William Lloyd Garrison,
and few men evinced a more genuine or a more exalted
piety. The Bible was his text book&mdash;held sacred,
as the word of the Eternal Father&mdash;sinless perfection&mdash;complete
submission to insults and injuries&mdash;literal
obedience to the injunction, if smitten on one
side to turn the other also. Not only was Sunday a
Sabbath, but all days were Sabbaths, and to be kept
holy. All sectarism false and mischievous&mdash;the regenerated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
throughout the world, members of one body,
and the <span class="smcap">Head</span> Jesus Christ. Prejudice against color
was rebellion against God. Of all men beneath the
sky, the slaves, because most neglected and despised,
were nearest and dearest to his great heart. Those
ministers who defended slavery from the Bible, were of
their 'father the devil;' and those churches which
fellowshipped slaveholders as Christians, were synagogues
of Satan, and our nation was a nation of liars.
Never loud or noisy&mdash;calm and serene as a summer sky,
and as pure. 'You are the man, the Moses, raised up
by God, to deliver his modern Israel from bondage,'
was the spontaneous feeling of my heart, as I sat away
back in the hall and listened to his mighty words;
mighty in truth&mdash;mighty in their simple earnestness."</p>

<p>From this time the course of Douglass is upward.
The manifest talents which he possessed, led the friends
of the Anti-Slavery cause to feel that he could serve it
better in a literary career than by manual labor.</p>

<p>In the year 1841, a great anti-slavery convention
was held at Nantucket, where Frederick Douglass appeared
on the stage and before a great audience recounted
his experiences. Mr. Garrison followed him,
and an immense enthusiasm was excited&mdash;and Douglass
says: "That night there were at least a thousand
Garrisonians in Nantucket." After this the general
agent of the Anti-Slavery Society came and offered to
Douglass the position of an agent of that society, with
a competent support to enable him to lecture through
the country. Douglass, continually pursuing the work
of self-education, became an accomplished speaker and
writer. He visited England, and was received with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
great enthusiasm. The interest excited in him was so
great that several English friends united and paid the
sum of one hundred and fifty pounds sterling, for the
purchase of his liberty. This enabled him to pursue his
work of lecturer in the United States, to travel unmolested,
and to make himself every way conspicuous
without danger of recapture.</p>

<p>He settled himself in Rochester, and established an
Anti-Slavery paper, called Frederick Douglass' Paper,
which bore a creditable character for literary execution,
and had a good number of subscribers in America
and England.</p>

<p>Two of Frederick Douglass' sons were among the
first to answer to the call for colored troops, and fought
bravely in the good cause. Douglass has succeeded in
rearing an intelligent and cultivated family, and in
placing himself in the front rank among intelligent
and cultivated men. Few orators among us surpass
him, and his history from first to last, is a comment on
the slavery system which speaks for itself.</p>

<p>Major-General Philip Henry Sheridan is a full-blooded
Irishman by descent, though American by birth.
He was born in poverty. So large a share of
American eminent men have been born poor, that it
might almost be said that in our country poverty in
youth is the first requisite for success in life.</p>

<p>Sheridan's parents, after remaining a few years at
the east, moved to Ohio, where their son grew up
with very little schooling, and under the useful necessity
of working for a living. There is a story current
of his having been put upon a spirited horse when a
boy of five, by some mischievous mates, and run away
with to a tavern some miles off. He stuck fast to the
horse, though without saddle or bridle, and without
size or strength to use them if he had them. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
by a mere chance that he arrived safe, and when
lifted off by the sympathizing family of the inn, the
little fellow admitted that he was shaken and sore with
his ride, but he added, "I'll be better to-morrow, <i>and
then I'll ride back home</i>." The incident is of no great
importance in itself, but it shows that even then the
boy was already constitutionally destitute of fear. He
seems to have been made without the peculiar faculty
which makes people take danger into the account, and
try to keep at a distance from it. The full possession
of this deficiency (if the phrase is not too direct a
contradiction in terms,) is quite uncommon. Admiral
Nelson had it, as was shown, very much in Sheridan's
own style, in his boyhood. The future victor of Trafalgar
had strayed away from home, and got lost.
When he had been found and taken home, a relative
remarked, "I should have thought that fear would
have kept you from going so far away." "Fear?"
said the young gentleman quite innocently; "Fear?
I don't know him!" He never afterwards made his
acquaintance, either; nor, it would seem, has Sheridan.</p>

<p>When young Sheridan received his appointment to
a cadetship at West Point, he was driving a water-cart
in Zanesville, Ohio. The person who actually procured
the appointment was Gen. Thomas P. Ritchey,
member of Congress from Sheridan's district. The
candidate was very young for the appointment, and
very small of his age, insomuch that his friends considered
it extremely doubtful whether he would be
admitted. He was, however, and passed through the
regular West Point course, in the same class with Generals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
McPherson, Scofield, Terrill, Sill and Tyler, and
with the rebel general Hood, who was so fearfully
beaten by Thomas at Nashville. His scholarship was
not particularly remarkable, and as is often the case
with pupils who have no particular want of courage,
high health and spirits, or of the bodily and mental
qualities for doing things rather than for thinking
about it, he experienced various collisions of one and
another kind, with the strict military discipline of the
institution.</p>

<p>He graduated in June, 1853, and as there was at
the moment no vacant second lieutenancy, he was given
a brevet appointment, and sent out in the next autumn
to Fort Duncan on the Rio Grande, at the western
edge of Texas, and in the region haunted by two of
the most ferocious and boldest of the tribes sometimes
called on the frontier the "horse Indians"&mdash;the Apaches
and Camanches.</p>

<p>From this time until the rebellion, Lieutenant Sheridan
was serving, not exactly his apprenticeship to his
trade of war, but what would in Germany be called
his <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">wanderjähre</i>&mdash;his years as wandering journeyman.
It was an eight years of training in hardships and
dangers more incessant and more extreme than perhaps
could be crowded into any life except this of the
American Indian-fighter; and doubtless its wild experiences
did much to develop the bodily and mental
endurance and the coolness and swift energy which
have characterized Sheridan as a commander.</p>

<p>For two years Sheridan was at Fort Duncan, and
was then promoted to first lieutenant, transferred to
the Fourth Regiment, and after some delay in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
York waiting for some recruits, he accompanied them
by sea to the Pacific coast, and immediately on reaching
San Francisco was placed in command of the
escort for a surveying expedition employed on a
branch of the Pacific Railroad. On this duty, and
afterwards in command of posts or on scouts and expeditions
up and down those remote and wild regions,
the time passed until the outbreak of the war in 1861.</p>

<p>In the fights and adventures of this rough life,
Sheridan's soldierly qualities were often exhibited.
While at Fort Duncan, being outside the fort with
two men, the three were surprised by a gang of a
dozen or more Apaches, whose chief, taking it for
granted that the three had surrendered, jumped down
from his horse, to tie them up and have them carried
off. As he did so, Sheridan, quick as lightning, sprang
up in his place, and goaded the wild mustang at full
speed to the fort. On reaching it, he called instantly
to arms, snatched a pair of pistols, and without dismounting
or waiting to see who followed, wheeled
and flew back as swiftly as he had come. His two
men were fighting stoutly for their lives. Sheridan
dashed up and shot the chief. The soldiers, following
hard after him, charged the savages, and in a moment
the discomfited Apaches were ridden down, dispersed
and most of them killed.</p>

<p>During Sheridan's stay in Oregon, his commanding
officer, Major Rains, (afterwards the rebel General
Rains,) made a campaign against the Yokima Indians,
in which Sheridan did right good service, and so conspicuously
at the affair of the Cascades on the Columbia,
April 28, 1856, as to be mentioned in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
orders with high praise. The Indians having been
subdued, were placed on a tract called the Yokima
Reservation, and Sheridan was appointed to command
a detachment of troops posted among them, to act
substantially as their governor. He erected a post
called Fort Yamhill, and remained there for two or
three years, ruling his wild subjects with a good deal
of success, and being quite popular with them, as well
as praised and trusted by his own superiors. An eye-witness
has told the story of an occurrence at Fort Yamhill,
a good deal like the affair of the Apaches at Fort
Duncan, and which equally illustrates the swift and vehement
courage with which Sheridan always does his
soldier's work. One day a quarrel arose in the camp
of the Yokimas, outside the fort. These turbulent
savages have no more self-control than so many tigers,
and in a moment their knives were out, and a bloody
battle-royal was opened. Sheridan was near enough
to see that there was a fight, but happened to be
alone. He put spurs to his horse, hurried to the fort,
ordered what few soldiers were in sight to follow
him, turned, set spurs to his horse again, and dashed
off for the Indian camp at the very top of his
speed; bare headed, sword in hand, <i>without once looking
round to see if he were followed</i>; and he charged
headlong into the fray, riding through the desperate
Indian knife-fight as though it were a field of standing
grain. The soldiers felt the powerful magnetism of
their leader, just as Sheridan's soldiers have always
felt it; and, our informant said, every man of them
drove on, just like his leader, without looking behind
to see if anybody followed. In they went, striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
right and left, and in a moment or two, they had
charged once or twice through the fight, and it was
quelled.</p>

<p>Sheridan was an efficient manager of these Indians,
and was popular with them, too. Their wild, keen
instincts appreciate courage and energy, sense and
kindness, quite as readily as do civilized men.</p>

<p>When the rebellion broke out, Sheridan was ordered
East, and on May 14, 1861, was commissioned captain
in the Thirteenth Regular Infantry. He was soon
sent to Missouri, where his first actual service in the
war was a term of office as president of a board for
auditing military claims. He was soon, however, sent
into the field as chief quartermaster and commissary
under Gen. Curtis, and in that capacity served through
the brilliant and victorious, but terribly severe campaign
in which the desperate battle of Pea Ridge was
fought. At this time his professional ambition was
not very high, for he observed one day that "he was
the sixty-fourth captain on the list, and with the chances
of war might soon be a major."</p>

<p>Sheridan is, however, thoroughly modest, and among
ladies is&mdash;or was&mdash;even excessively bashful. There
is an amusing story on this point about this very campaign.
It is, that Sheridan, too bashful to seek for
himself the company of a certain young lady near
Springfield, used to furnish a horse and carriage to a
smart young clerk of his, conditionally that the said
clerk should take the young lady out to drive and entertain
her&mdash;very much as Captain Miles Standish is
said to have once deputed John Alden on a similar
errand. The clerk did so, while Captain Sheridan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
stood in the door and experienced a shy delight in
seeing how well the substitute did duty. No end is
known for this story&mdash;except, indeed, that Captain
Sheridan did not marry the lady.</p>

<p>There are on record some reminiscences of Sheridan's
character as an officer in this campaign, which
paint him in a very agreeable light, as at once energetic
and thorough in duty, and kindly in feeling and
manner. It was a fellow-officer who thus wrote:</p>

<p>"The enlisted men on duty at headquarters, or in
his own bureau, remember him kindly. Not a clerk
or orderly but treasures some act of kindness done by
Captain Sheridan. Never forgetting, nor allowing
others to forget, the respect due to him and his position,
he was yet the most approachable officer at headquarters.
His knowledge of the regulations and customs
of the army, and of all professional minutiæ,
were ever at the disposal of any proper inquirer.
Private soldiers are seldom allowed to carry away as
pleasant and kindly recollections of a superior as those
with which Captain Sheridan endowed us. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
No man has risen more rapidly with less jealousy, if
the feelings entertained by his old associates of the
Army of the Southwest are any criterion."</p>

<p>Sheridan's next service was as General Halleck's
chief quartermaster in the Corinth campaign. Halleck
seems to have thought very well of Sheridan from the
first, though apparently rather as a trustworthy organizer
and manager, than as such a military son of thunder
as he has turned out to be. After a time the nature
of the war in those parts occasioned a great demand
for cavalry officers, and Sheridan being pitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
upon for one, was on May 27, 1862, commissioned
colonel of the 2d Michigan Cavalry, and was at once
sent into the field to help impede the retreat of the
rebels when they should evacuate Corinth.</p>

<p>In this and other similar work of that campaign, Sheridan
became at once known to the army and to his superiors
as a splendid officer, and from that time forward
he rose and rose, up to the very last scene of the Virginia
campaign, where he wielded the troops that
struck the most telling of the final blows against Lee.</p>

<p>His first important service was to take part in Elliott's
Booneville expedition. In June he had a cavalry
combat with the butcher Forrest, and beat him, and
was made acting brigadier. In July, having two regiments
with him, he was attacked by the rebel Chalmers
with six thousand men. Sheridan's position was
strong enough, but he saw that he would shortly be
surrounded and starved out by mere weight of numbers.
So he contrived a neat and effective surprise;
risky, it is true; but it is exactly the character of an
able commander to take risks at the right time, <i>and
not lose</i>. Sheridan sent round to the enemy's rear, by
a long detour, a force of about ninety troopers, with
instructions to fall on at a given time, when he would
attack in concert with them. This was done; the
bold squad fired so fast from their repeating carbines
that the rebels, startled and perplexed, could not estimate
on the probable number attacking them, and
were thrown into confusion. At this moment, Sheridan
charged in front with his whole force, and in his
own manner, and Chalmers' men, instantly breaking,
fled in total rout, and were pursued twenty miles, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
the whole road strewn with weapons, accoutrements
and baggage thrown away in their flight. General
Grant, at this time Sheridan's department commander,
reported in strong commendation of Sheridan's
conduct in this affair, and asked a brigadier's
commission for him, which was accordingly given,
dated July 15th, the day of Chalmers' first attack.
Sheridan seems to like to be attacked. He is sure of
himself and of his men, conscious of his own coolness,
view of the field, recognition of the "critical five seconds,"
and promptness in moving, and he prepares a
return stroke apparently quite as gladly as he administers
a first assault.</p>

<p>When, in the summer of 1862, General Bragg advanced
by a line far east of the Union forces in the
valley of the Mississippi, with the idea of reaching
the Ohio, and carrying the war into the North, Grant
sent Sheridan to Buell, commanding in Kentucky, who
gave him a division and placed him in command of
Louisville. Here Sheridan in one night completed a
tolerable line of defence, and waited with confidence
for an attack, but Bragg never got so far. On Bragg's
retreat was fought the battle of Perrysville, which
was given by the rebel leader to gain time for his
trains to escape from the rapid pursuit of the Union
army. In this battle, Sheridan with his division held
the key of the Union position, repulsed several desperate
assaults, and twice, charging in his turn, drove
the rebels from their positions before him. His division
lost heavily, but he inflicted heavier losses on the
rebels, and his prompt tactics and keen fighting saved
the Union army from defeat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
In the terrible fight of Stone River, or Murfreesboro',
Sheridan's part, instead of being merely creditable
or handsome, was glorious and decisive. But for
him, that great battle would have been a tremendous
defeat. How desperate the need of the crisis that
Sheridan met there, and how well he met it, may
somewhat appear from the terms used by the best historian
thus far of that battle, in prefacing the detailed
account which he gives of the fighting of Sheridan
and his men. Mr. Swinton says:</p>

<p>"The difference between troops is great; the difference
between officers is immensely greater. While
the two right divisions of McCook were being assailed
and brushed away, an equal hostile pressure fell upon
his left division (Sheridan's). But here a quite other
result attended the enemy's efforts; for not only were
the direct attacks repulsed with great slaughter, but
when the flank of the division was uncovered by the
withdrawal of the troops on its right, its commander
effecting a skilful change of front, threw his men into
position at right angles with his former line, and having
thus made for himself a new flank, buffeted with
such determined vigor and such rapid turns of offence,
that for two hours he held the Confederates at bay&mdash;<i>hours
precious, priceless, wrenched from fate and an
exultant foe by the skill and courage of this officer</i>, and
bought by the blood of his valiant men. This officer
was Brigadier-General P.&nbsp;H. Sheridan."</p>

<p>Few fights were ever more splendidly soldierly than
this of Sheridan's. We cannot detail it; but when
left with his flank totally uncovered, and where he
would have been perfectly justified in retreating, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
changed front under fire&mdash;the most difficult of all military
manoeuvres, repulsed the triumphant enemy four
times, held his ground until all three of his brigade
commanders were shot; fought until all his ammunition
was gone, and no more to be had; then took to
charging with the cold steel; and when at last he had
to retreat, he brought off in good order the force that
was left, "with compact ranks and empty cartridge
boxes," having lost seventeen hundred and ninety-six
brave men, and having gained the time which saved
the battle; and reporting to Rosecrans, he said with
sorrow, "Here is all that are left." The hot blooded
Rousseau, who had been sent with his reserves into the
dark, close cedar thickets where Sheridan was fighting,
described the scene in words that enable the imagination
to conceive what must have been the reality of
which a soldier spoke thus:</p>

<p>"I knew it was hell in there before I got in, but I
was convinced of it when I saw Phil Sheridan, with
hat in one hand and sword in the other, fighting as if
he were the devil incarnate, or had a fresh indulgence
from Father Tracy every five minutes."</p>

<p>Father Tracy was Rosecrans' chaplain&mdash;Rosecrans
and Sheridan both being Catholics. It may be added
that those who know Sheridan's battle manners, may
perhaps suspect that, he needed indulgence for some
offence in words as well as deeds. Gen. Sheridan was
made major-general for his services at Murfreesboro'.</p>

<p>We cannot do more than hastily sum up the later
and even more brilliant portion of Sheridan's splendid
career; and indeed it is so much better known that
the task is the less needful. Sheridan was active and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
useful during Rosecrans' advance on Chattanooga. At
the defeat of Chickamauga, his services were so conspicuous
in making the best of a bad matter, that
Rosecrans in his report, "commended him to his country."</p>

<p>Grant now succeeded Rosecrans, and gained the
battle of Chattanooga, Monday, Nov. 23, 1863. In
the storming of Missionary Ridge, which was the central
glory of that fight, Sheridan and his men bore a
conspicuous part. When Grant was made Lieutenant
General, he quickly ordered Sheridan to report at
Washington. Sheridan went, not knowing whether
for praise or blame, and was placed in command of all
the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac. When
Grant crossed the Rapidan, and began that bloody
and toilsome, but shattering and finally decisive series
of movements which ended with the surrender of the
Rebellion, Sheridan and his horsemen were employed
in reconnoitering and guarding trains. May 9th, he
set out on a raid around the rear of Lee's army, in
which he cut up communications, destroyed supplies,
and rescued prisoners; beat the rebel cavalry, killing
its leader, J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Stuart; penetrated within two
miles of Richmond, thoroughly frightening the rebel
capital; extricated his force from a very difficult position
on the Chickahominy, by his peculiar style of
swift manoeuvre and furious fighting; and came safe
through at last to Butler's headquarters.</p>

<p>On another similar expedition in June, he severely
damaged the rebel routes of supply to Richmond from
the north and west; and for some time after that, his
cavalry were overrunning the country south of Petersburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
and Richmond, while Grant was establishing himself
in the lines before Petersburg.</p>

<p>Sheridan's great historic campaign in the Valley of
Virginia was the crowning glory of his splendid career
in the war; a career perhaps more brilliant with the
gleams of battles than that of any other commander.
This fatal valley had from the very beginning of the
war been the opprobrium of the Union armies. From it
came General Johnston and those forces that reinforced
Beauregard at Bull Run, and turned that hap-hazard
fight into a victory for the rebels. Through it,
alternating with the ground east of the Blue Ridge,
the rebels moved backward and forward, as they
chose, like a checker-player in the "whip-row." In
it, one Union commander after another had been defeated
and made to look ridiculous; and it was the
road along which every invasion of the North, east of
the mountains, was laid out, as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Sheridan turned this den of disgraces into a theatre
all ablaze with victories. He was appointed to the
command Aug. 7, 1864; for six or seven weeks simply
covered the harvests from the rebel foragers; during
September was at last given leave by Grant to deliver
battle; September 19th, defeated Early at Winchester;
September 22d, defeated him again at Fisher's Hill,
whither he had retreated; and when the rebel commander
retreated again to the far southern passes of
the Blue Ridge, Sheridan laid the southern part of the
valley thoroughly waste, to prevent the enemy from
finding support in it; on the 19th of October, after
his army had been surprised by the persevering Early,
defeated, and driven in disorder five miles, Sheridan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
faced it about, and turned the defeat into the most
dramatic, brilliant and famous of all his victories.</p>

<p>In February of the following year, Sheridan took a
place in that vast ring of bayonets and sabres with
which Grant sought to envelop the remaining armies
of the rebellion. On the 27th of that month, he
moved rapidly up the valley of his victories, ran over
what was left of Early's force, smashed it and captured
two-thirds of it almost without stopping, then crossed
the Ridge, destroyed the James river canal, and breaking
up railroads and bridges as he went, rode across
the country to White House, and thence once more
joined Grant below Petersburg. Last of all, in the
final campaign from March 29th to Lee's surrender on
April 9th, Sheridan and his troops were the strong
left hand of Grant in all those operations; thrust furthest
out around Lee, feeling and feeling after him,
clutching him whenever there was a chance, crushing
him like a vice at every grasp, and throttling him with
relentless force, until the very power of further resistance
was gone, and that proposed charge of Sheridan's
which was stopped by Lee's flag of truce, would
really have been made upon an almost helpless and
disorganized mass of starving, worn-out soldiers and
disordered wagon-trains.</p>

<p>General Sheridan's administration as military governor
at New Orleans, was a surprise to his friends,
from its exhibition of broad and high administrative
qualities. Yet there is much that is alike in the abilities
of a good general and a good ruler. Gen. Grant
is a very wise judge of men, and his brief and characteristic
record of his estimate of Sheridan might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
have justified hopes equal to the actual result. To
any one remembering also his early days of authority
over the Yokimas in Oregon, it would doubtless have
done so; for a Yokima community and the community
of an "unreconstructed" southern rebel city are a
good deal alike in many things. What Grant said of
Sheridan was as follows, and was sent to Secretary
Stanton just after Cedar Creek, and a little while before
Sheridan's appointment as Major-General in the Regular
Army, in place of McClellan, resigned:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
"<span class="smcap">City Point</span>, Thursday, Oct. 20, 8 p. m.
</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Hon. E. M. Stanton</span>, etc.:</p>

<p>I had a salute of one hundred guns from each of the
armies here fired in honor of Sheridan's last victory.
Turning what bid fair to be a disaster into a glorious
victory, stamps Sheridan <i>what I always thought him,
one of the ablest of generals</i>.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">U. S. Grant</span>, Lieutenant-General."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The extraordinary series of popular ovations which
have attended Sheridan's recent tour through part of
the North, have proved that he is profoundly admired,
honored and loved by all good citizens; and unless we
except Grant, probably Sheridan is the most popular&mdash;and
deservedly the most popular&mdash;of all the commanders
in the war. Such a popularity, and won not
by words but by deeds, is an enviable possession.</p>

<p>Many men of a very lofty grade of power and excellence
have arisen in our country, among a class who
may be described as of Eastern blood but Western development.
They have themselves been born at the
East, or else their parents had either lived there or
had been trained in the ways of the East. Then,
growing up in the freer atmosphere, the more spontaneous
life, the larger scale of being, of the West, they
have as it were, themselves enlarged in mind, and have
seemingly become better fitted to cope with vast executive
problems. Thus, President Lincoln was of
Eastern Quaker blood; General Grant, of Connecticut
blood; Secretary Chase, of New Hampshire blood;
General Sherman, of Connecticut blood; but they
were all either of Western birth or else trained up in
Western habits of thought, sentiment and action. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
West is larger, stronger, freer, than the East, and it
affords a better opportunity for great, spontaneous and
powerful men.</p>

<p>Perhaps no family in the whole United States was
better adapted to supply first-class men by this process
than the Shermans'. For generations they have
been of strong, practical, thoughtful minds, employed
in the highest occupations, laborious and efficient in
action, pure and lofty in moral tone and character.
Roger Minot Sherman, the Revolutionary statesman,
was of this stock, though not in the same direct line
with the General. General Sherman's grandfather,
Hon. Taylor Sherman, was long a judge in Connecticut,
and his father, Hon. Charles R. Sherman, was also
a judge, having occupied the bench of the Superior
Court of Ohio during the last six years of his life. He
died in 1829, leaving his widow in narrow circumstances,
with eleven children. Of these, Charles T.
Sherman, the eldest, has since been a successful lawyer
at Washington; William Tecumseh, the General,
was the sixth, and John, the energetic, loyal and useful
Senator from Ohio, the seventh. The name of Tecumseh
was given in consequence of Judge Sherman's admiration
of the noble qualities of that famous chief.</p>

<p>Thomas Ewing, the eminent Whig politician, speaker
and statesman, had been an intimate personal friend
of Judge Sherman, and when the boy, in those days
commonly called by the unlovely nickname of "Cump,"
from his Indian name of Tecumseh, was about nine
years old, Mr. Ewing kindly adopted him and assumed
the entire charge of his support and education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
Mr. Ewing, in speaking to one of General Sherman's
biographers of his character as a boy, described him as
not particularly noticeable otherwise than as a good
scholar and a steady, honest, intelligent fellow. He
said that he "never knew so young a boy who would
do an errand so promptly and correctly as he did.
He was transparently honest, faithful, and reliable.
Studious and correct in his habits, his progress in education
was steady and substantial."</p>

<p>In 1836, Mr. Ewing was a member of Congress
from Ohio, and having the right to nominate a cadet
at West Point, he offered the appointment to his adopted
son, who gladly accepted it, and went successfully
through the course of study, graduating in 1840. It
is a good illustration of the wholesome stringency of
the discipline there, that Sherman's class was a hundred
and forty strong when it entered, but only forty-two
were left to graduate. The rest had fainted by
the way for lack of knowledge or energy, or had been
dismissed for some fault. In this "Gideon's band" of
forty-two, Sherman stood sixth. A short extract from
one of his letters while a cadet shows a curious specimen
of the same mixture of peremptory sternness in
exacting duties and substantial kindness to those who
deserved it <i>but no others</i>, which have so often been
noted in him since. He writes about the freshman
who was according to custom under his particular
charge, by the local appellation of a "pleb," as follows:</p>

<p>"As to lording it over the plebs, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I had
only one, whom I made, of course, tend to a pleb's
duty, such as bringing water, policing the tent, cleaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
my gun and accoutrements and the like, and repaid
in the usual and cheap coin&mdash;advice; and since
we have commenced studying, I make him <i>bone</i> (<i>i. e.</i>
study,) and explain to him the difficult parts of algebra
and the French grammar, since he is a good one
and a fine fellow; but should he not carry himself
straight I should have him found (<i>i. e.</i>, rejected at examination)
in January and sent off, that being the
usual way in such cases, and then take his bed, table
and chair, to pay for the Christmas spree." It is evident
that while he was well enough satisfied to help
his "fine fellow," he would not have cried much while
he saw him turned away if for sufficient cause, or when
he proceeded to confiscate his scanty furniture.</p>

<p>Sherman was commissioned at graduating, Second
Lieutenant in the third U.&nbsp;S. Artillery; in November
1841 joined his company at Fort Pierce, in East Florida;
in January 1842 became First Lieutenant, and
served successfully at different points in Florida, at
Fort Morgan on Mobile Point, Fort Moultrie in Charleston
Harbor, and other posts in the South, for some
years. During this time the natural elevation of his
character saved him from the frivolous or shameful indulgences
too often fallen into by officers on garrison
duty; he read and studied works on his profession,
acquainted himself with the common law, and amused
himself with petting birds and beasts, fishing, hunting
and occasionally with visiting.</p>

<p>When the Mexican War broke out he was at first
sent on recruiting duty, but he quickly set to work to
beg for active service, and on June 29, 1846, he at last
received an order to join his company at New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
on the way to California, to meet Kearny's expedition
across the plains. He set out the very next day, without
waiting to visit even Miss Ewing, his guardian's
daughter, to whom he was engaged, and sailed with
his company in the storeship Lexington, under the
command of Lieut. Theodorus Bailey, now Rear-Admiral.
General Ord and General Halleck were fellow
lieutenants with Sherman, and sailed with him. An account
written by a shipmate during this voyage, thus
describes Sherman:</p>

<p>"The first lieutenant was a tall, spare man, apparently
about thirty years of age, with sandy hair and
whiskers, and a reddish complexion. Grave in his
demeanor, erect and soldierly in his bearing, he was
especially noticeable for the faded and threadbare appearance
of his uniform. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* He was characterized
at this time by entire devotion to his profession
in all its details. His care for both the comfort and
discipline of his men was constant and unwearied."</p>

<p>His California campaigns were not very adventurous,
but he became reputed an excellent business officer
in his staff appointment as assistant adjutant-general.
Returning in 1850, he married Miss Ewing, May 1st,
of that year. In September he was made a commissary
of subsistence with the rank of Captain; in March
1851, was commissioned brevet Captain, "for meritorious
services in California," and in September 1853,
seeing no prospects in the army that satisfied him, he
resigned, and became manager of Lucas, Miner &amp; Co's
branch banking house at San Francisco.</p>

<p>It is probable that the superintendency of the Louisiana
State Military Academy, which with a salary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
$5,000 was offered to him and accepted in 1860, was
intended to secure his own co-operation in case of secession,
or at least his services in training southern officers.
But his term of office was not long; although
as has been sarcastically observed, "since then, he has
had the opportunity to still further educate his former
pupils." He had not been in his new post a half year,
when, foreseeing the necessary result of the counsels
of the South, and not waiting for the overt act which
almost all other good citizens needed to open their
eyes, he decided upon his course, and wrote to Governor
Moore a letter which has been often printed, but
which cannot be too often printed; a noble and simple
avowal of patriotic principle and duty. It was as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<i>January 8, 1861.</i>
</p>

<p class="in0">"Governor <span class="smcap">Thomas O. Moore</span>, Baton Rouge, Louisiana:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;As I occupy a <i>quasi</i>-military position under
this State, I deem it proper to acquaint you that I accepted
such position when Louisiana was a State in
the Union, and when the motto of the seminary was
inserted in marble over the main door, 'By the liberality
of the General Government of the United States.
The Union: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Esto Perpetua</i>.'</p>

<p>"Recent events foreshadow a great change, and it
becomes all men to choose. If Louisiana withdraws
from the Federal Union, I prefer to maintain my allegiance
to the old Constitution as long as a fragment of
it survives, and my longer stay here would be wrong
in every sense of the word. In that event, I beg you
will send or appoint some authorized agent to take
charge of the arms and munitions of war here belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
to the State, or direct me what disposition should
be made of them.</p>

<p>"And furthermore, as President of the Board of Supervisors,
I beg you to take immediate steps to relieve
me as superintendent the moment the State determines
to secede; for on no earthly account will I do any act,
or think any thought, hostile to or in defiance of the
old Government of the United States.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">With great respect, &amp;c.,</span><br />
(Signed,) <span class="in6">W. T. SHERMAN."</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The rebels had lost their general. His resignation
was at once accepted, and Sherman went to St. Louis,
where he had left his family, and impatient of idleness,
became superintendent of a street railroad company,
and so remained until after the surrender of Sumter.</p>

<p>He now went to Washington and offered his services
to Government. Secretary Cameron replied, "The
ebullition of feeling will soon subside; we shall not
need many troops." Mr. Lincoln replied, "We shall
not need many men like you; the storm will soon blow
over." In short, Sherman could not make anybody
believe him, and he experienced a good deal of the
disagreeable fate of prophets of evil; and not for the
last time either. But he was totally unmoved in his
conviction; he refused to have any thing to do with
raising three-months' men, saying, "You might as well
attempt to put out the flames of a burning house with
a squirt-gun;" and he still vainly urged the government
with all his might to fling the whole military
power of the country at once upon the rebellion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
crush the beginning of it. When, however, the regular
army was enlarged, Sherman applied for a command
in the new force, and Gen. McDowell readily
procured him a commission as Colonel of the 13th
Regular Infantry, and in the meanwhile, the regiment
not being yet raised, he served as brigadier in the battle
of Bull Run, under Gen. Tyler, commanding a division.</p>

<p>In this defeat, Sherman and his brigade did very
creditably. His promptitude in going into action, and
his good fighting, were of great use in gaining the
advantages of the beginning of the battle; he did
not retreat until ordered to do so, and retired in comparatively
good order. He used his natural freedom
and plainness of speech in observing upon the conduct
of his own officers and men during the battle, and made
enemies thereby; but he had so clearly shown himself
a good and ready soldier, that when his brother the
Senator and the Ohio delegation urged his appointment
as brigadier-general of volunteers it was soon given
him, and after remaining in the Army of the Potomac
until September, 1861, he was sent to Kentucky, as
second in command under Gen. Anderson, commanding
the department. A month afterwards, Anderson's
health having broken down, Sherman succeeded him.</p>

<p>In a few days, Mr. Secretary Cameron, and Adjutant-General
Lorenzo Thomas, came to Louisville, in a
hurry to have the new department commander beat
the rebels and secure Kentucky to the Union. Sherman
knew war, almost intuitively; he knew the resources
and the spirit of the rebels, and the military
characteristics of Kentucky, and of Tennessee behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
it. "How many troops," asked the Secretary of War,
"do you require in your department?" "Sixty thousand,"
answered Sherman, "to drive the enemy out of
Kentucky; two hundred thousand to finish the war in
this section." This seems to have struck the two inquirers
as sheer nonsense; and in the adjutant-general's
report, which&mdash;as if to help the rebels to as full
information as possible&mdash;was at once printed in all the
newspapers, with full particulars of the state of the
armies at the west, Sherman's estimate was barely announced,
without explanation or comment. All those
persons who understood less of war than Sherman,
now at once set him down for a man of no sense or
judgment. A disreputable newspaper correspondent,
enraged at Sherman for some reason, seized the opportunity
to set afloat a story that Sherman was actually
crazy, and the lie was really believed by multitudes all
over the United States. The war-prophet was misunderstood
and despised again, even more remarkably
than when he foretold a long war, before Bull Run.
Sherman's official superiors so far sympathised with
this clamor as to supersede him by Gen. Buell, and to
send him to Gen. Halleck, who had faith enough left
in him to put him in charge of the recruiting rendezvous
at Benton Barracks, St. Louis.</p>

<p>Here he remained, hard at work on mere details, all
winter. When Grant, having taken Fort Henry, came
down the Tennessee, and turning about, ascended the
Cumberland, to attack Donelson, Gen. Sherman was
ordered to Paducah, to superintend the sending forward
of supplies and reinforcements, a duty which he
performed with so much speed and efficiency, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
Gen. Grant reported himself "greatly indebted for his
promptness."</p>

<p>After Donelson, Sherman was appointed to the fifth
of the six divisions in which Grant organized the
army with which he advanced by Nashville to Shiloh;
the greenest of all the divisions, no part of it having
been under fire, or even under military discipline. At
the battle of Shiloh, Sherman's troops, with the magnificent
inborn courage of the western men, green as
they were, fought like veterans; and his and McClernand's
divisions were the only part of Grant's army
that at all held their ground, and even this was only
done after twice falling back to new positions, in consequence
of the giving way of troops on either hand.
It was with Sherman that Grant agreed, before he
knew of the close approach of reinforcements, to attack
in the morning; and after the disappointed Beauregard
had retreated next day, it was Sherman who
moved his division in pursuit; although the exhausted
and disorganized condition of the troops prevented
continuing the pursuit. He was severely wounded by
a bullet through the left hand on the first day of the
fight; bandaged the wound and kept on fighting;
was wounded again the next day, and had three
horses shot under him, but rode out the battle on the
fourth. Though the very first battle in which he had
held an independent command&mdash;for it was to a great
degree such&mdash;so thoroughly was he master of the
"profession in all its details," to which he had seemed
so devoted when a lieutenant on shipboard, that he
seems to have found no embarrassment in using all
the resources which any commander could have employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
in his place. Halleck, a man sparing of compliments,
in asking that Sherman should be made
major-general of volunteers, said: "It is the unanimous
opinion here that Brigadier-General W.&nbsp;T. Sherman
saved the fortunes of the day on the 6th, and
contributed largely to the glorious victory of the 7th."</p>

<p>And General Grant, whose noble friendship with
Sherman, beginning about this time, has continued
unbroken ever since, spoke subsequently in still more
decided and generous terms, when asking for Sherman
a commission as brigadier in the regular service. He
wrote to the War Department:</p>

<p>"At the battle of Shiloh, on the first day, he held,
with raw troops, the key point of the landing. It is
no disparagement to any other officer to say, that I
do not believe there was another division commander
on the field who had the skill and experience to have
done it. To his individual efforts I am indebted for
the success of that battle."</p>

<p>During the following operations against and
around Corinth, Sherman and his division did
most excellent service. He had now received his
commission as a major-general of volunteers. When
Grant became commander of the Department of the
Tennessee, in July, 1862, at the time of Halleck's appointment
as general-in-chief, he placed Sherman in
command of the bitterly and perseveringly rebel city
of Memphis, which Sherman governed sternly, shrewdly,
thoroughly and well, under the laws of war, until
autumn.</p>

<p>In Grant's first attempt against Vicksburg, Sherman's
attack by Chickasaw Bluffs, was an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
part of the plan. It failed, because the other parts&mdash;Grant's
march in consequence of the surrender of
Holly Springs, and Banks' movement from New Orleans
for other reasons&mdash;did not succeed; but Grant,
in afterwards examining the ground, said that Sherman's
arrangement was "admirable."</p>

<p>The capture of the strong rebel fort at Arkansas
Post, January 11, 1863, was a suggestion of General
Sherman's, who commanded the land force which carried
the fort, after one day's fire, with the hearty help
of Admiral Porter's fleet.</p>

<p>In Grant's successive attempts against Vicksburg,
Sherman was an indefatigable and most efficient helper.
In the final move across the river south of the
place, Sherman co-operated by amusing the enemy
with a false attack at Haines' Bluff, which was kept
up with great ostentation during two days, a large
rebel force being thus detained from going down the
river to oppose Grant's crossing there. In the series
of marches and battles that cut off Johnston from
Pemberton, destroyed the military importance for the
time being of the city of Jackson, and drove Pemberton
into the lines of Vicksburg; and during the siege,
in effectually preventing any chance of relief from
Johnston, Sherman's services were constant and valuable.
Instantly upon the surrender, he moved his
army corps against Jackson, where Johnston had halted,
and by way of finish to the campaign, drove him
out, and thoroughly broke up the railroad lines meeting
there. We quote again Grant's frank acknowledgment
of the services of his great lieutenant:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
"The siege of Vicksburg and last capture of Jackson
and dispersion of Johnston's army entitle Gen. Sherman
to more credit than generally falls to the lot of one man
to earn. His demonstration at Haines' Bluff, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* his
rapid marches to join the army afterwards; his management
at Jackson, Mississippi, in the first attack;
his almost unequaled march from Jackson to Bridgeport,
and passage of Black River; his securing Walnut
Hills on the 18th of May, attest his great merit as
a soldier."</p>

<p>General Sherman's commission as brigadier in the
regular army, dated July 4, 1863, the day of the fall
of Vicksburg, reached him August 14th, following;
and we quote a passage of his letter to General Grant
on the occasion, for the pleasant purpose of recording
it near Grant's expressions of obligation to Sherman:</p>

<p>"I had the satisfaction to receive last night the appointment
as brigadier-general in the regular army,
with a letter from General Halleck, very friendly and
complimentary in its terms. I know that I owe this to
your favor, and beg to acknowledge it and add, that I
value the commission far less than the fact that this
will associate my name with yours and McPherson's in
opening the Mississippi, an achievement the importance
of which cannot be over-estimated.</p>

<p>"I beg to assure you of my deep personal attachment,
and to express the hope that the chances
of war will leave me to serve near and under you till
the dawn of that peace for which we are contending,
with the only purpose that it shall be honorable and
lasting."</p>

Rosecrans was defeated at Chickamauga by Bragg,
Sept. 19th and 20th, 1863. On this, Grant was placed
in command of the whole Military Division of the
Mississippi, and Sherman under him over the Department
of the Tennessee. He was at once set to march
his troops four hundred miles across to Grant at Chattanooga;
accomplished it with wonderful energy,
skill and speed; commanded Grant's left at the battle
of Chattanooga, beginning the fight, and sustaining and
drawing the rebel attacks until their center was weakened
enough to enable the Union center under Thomas
to storm Missionary Ridge, and win the battle. After
the victory and the enemy's pursuit, Sherman's force
was sent straightway northward a further hundred
miles, to relieve Burnside, now perilously beset in
Knoxville. Colonel Bowman thus powerfully states
the task which this energetic and enduring commander
and army performed:</p>

<p>"A large part of Sherman's command had marched
from Memphis, had gone into battle immediately on
arriving at Chattanooga, and had had no rest since.
In the late campaign officers and men had carried no
luggage and provisions. The week before, they had
left their camps, on the right bank of the Tennessee,
with only two days' rations, without a change of clothing,
stripped for the fight, each officer and man,
from the commanding general down, having but a
single blanket or overcoat. They had now no provisions
save what had been gathered by the road, and
were ill supplied for such a march. Moreover, the
weather was intensely cold. But twelve thousand of
their fellow-soldiers were beleaguered in a mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
town eighty-four miles distant; they needed relief,
and must have it in three days. This was enough.
Without a murmur, without waiting for anything, the
Army of the Tennessee directed its course upon Knoxville."</p>

<p>This vigorous forced march was entirely successful;
Longstreet, after one violent and vain assault against
Burnside's works, fled eastward into Virginia, and
Sherman, returning and placing his troops in camp to
rest and refresh, returned to Memphis. While there,
March 10, 1864, he received that simple and noble
letter from Grant, acknowledging the latter's obligations
to Sherman and McPherson, which we have copied
in our chapter on General Grant. We quote Sherman's
reply, which is indeed not less interesting than
the letter as a display of frank and manly friendship,
and which moreover contains one of Sherman's characteristic
prophecies, viz., the final allusion to the
winding up of the war by the "Great March," and the
siege of Richmond, when the West should once more
have been made sure:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear General</span>:&mdash;I have your more than kind
and characteristic letter of the 4th inst. I will send
a copy to General McPherson at once.</p>

<p>"You do yourself injustice and us too much
honor in assigning to us too large a share of
the merits which have led to your high advancement.
I know you approve the friendship I have ever professed
to you, and will permit me to continue, as heretofore,
to manifest it on all proper occasions.</p>

<p>"You are now Washington's legitimate successor, and
occupy a position of almost dangerous elevation; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
if you can continue, as heretofore, to be yourself,
simple, honest and unpretending, you will enjoy
through life the respect and love of friends, and the
homage of millions of human beings, that will award
you a large share in securing to them and their descendants
a government of law and stability.</p>

<p>"I repeat, you do General McPherson and myself
too much honor. At Belmont you manifested your
traits&mdash;neither of us being near. At Donelson, also,
you illustrated your whole character. I was not near,
and General McPherson in too subordinate a capacity
to influence you.</p>

<p>"Until you had won Donelson, I confess I was almost
cowed by the terrible array of anarchical elements
that presented themselves at every point; but
that admitted a ray of light I have followed since.</p>

<p>"I believe you are as brave, patriotic, and just as
the great prototype, Washington&mdash;as unselfish, kind-hearted,
and honest as a man should be&mdash;but the chief
characteristic is the simple faith in success you have
always manifested, which I can liken to nothing else
than the faith a Christian has in the Saviour.</p>

<p>"This faith gave you victory at Shiloh and Vicksburg.
Also, when you have completed your preparations,
you go into battle without hesitation, as at Chattanooga&mdash;no
doubts&mdash;no reverses; and I tell you it
was this that made us act with confidence. I knew,
wherever I was, that you thought of me, and if I got
in a tight place you would help me out, if alive.</p>

<p>"My only point of doubts was in your knowledge
of grand strategy, and of books of science and history;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
but I confess, your common sense seems to have
supplied all these.</p>

<p>"Now, as to the future. Don't stay in Washington.
Come West; take to yourself the whole Mississippi
Valley. Let us make it dead sure&mdash;and I tell you,
the Atlantic slopes and Pacific shores will follow its
destiny, as sure as the limbs of a tree live or die with
the main trunk. We have done much, but still much
remains. Time and time's influences are with us. We
could almost afford to sit still, and let these influences
work.</p>

<p>"Here lies the seat of the coming empire, and from
the West, when our task is done, we will make short
work of Charleston and Richmond, and the impoverished
coast of the Atlantic.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Your sincere friend,</span><br />
W. T. SHERMAN."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Grant was appointed Lieutenant-General,
Sherman succeeded him in the great command of the
Department of the Mississippi; and accompanying
Grant from Nashville to Cincinnati on the road of the
former to Washington, the two great commanders on
the way and at the Burnet House in Cincinnati, agreed
together upon the whole main structure of that colossal
campaign which during the following thirteen
months smote into annihilation all that remained of
the military power of the rebellion.</p>

<p>Sherman at once set to work to accumulate stores
sufficient for a campaign, and his own statements of
his motives and views in so doing, are so comically like
his doctrines about his "pleb" when a cadet at West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
Point, that we quote a couple of passages. Having
put a stop to the government issues of rations to the
poor of East Tennessee, he says:</p>

<p>"At first my orders operated very hardly, but *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* no
actual suffering resulted, and I trust that
those who clamored at the cruelty and hardships of the
day have already seen in the result a perfect justification
of my course."</p>

<p>Seeing it himself, it is moreover clear that if they
did not, it would not particularly distress him. In stating
how he proposed to live if he marched into Georgia,
he is as independently and rigidly just:</p>

<p>"Georgia has a million of inhabitants. If they can
live, we should not starve. If the enemy interrupt
my communications, I will be absolved from all obligations
to subsist on my own resources, but feel perfectly
justified in taking whatever and wherever I can
find. I will inspire my command, if successful, with
my feelings, and that beef and salt are all that are absolutely
necessary to life, and parched corn fed General
Jackson's army once, on that very ground."</p>

<p>All things being ready, Sherman moved from Chattanooga
on May 6th, 1864, and by a series of laborious
marches, skillful manœuvres and well fought battles,
flanked or drove Johnston backwards from one
strong post to another, until on the 17th of July, Jefferson
Davis greatly simplified and shortened Sherman's
problem by putting the rash and incompetent Hood in
the place of the skillful and persevering soldier who had
with less than half Sherman's force, by using the natural
advantages of the country, made him take seventy-two
days to advance a hundred miles, and at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
of that time actually had more troops than at first,
while Sherman had many less. In fact, Johnston was
on the very point of making a dangerous attack on
Sherman at the right point, when Hood took command,
at once attacked on the wrong one, and was defeated.
Still advancing, Sherman manœuvred Hood
out of Atlanta; saw that mad bull of a general set off
some months later, head down and eyes shut, on his
way to dash himself against the steady strength of
Thomas at Nashville; and turning back to Atlanta, he
prepared for his Great March to the Sea.</p>

<p>He had already cleaned Atlanta clean of rebels; exporting
all of them within their own military lines,
and meeting their own and also Hood's appeals, respectively
piteous and enraged, with sarcastic answers
in his own inimitable style of cold sharp just reasoning.
He made the city nothing but a place of arms;
and having almost exactly the force of all arms that
he had required for his purpose&mdash;for his Cassandra
days were over, and his country was by this time glad
and prompt to believe him and give him the tools he
needed to do its work with&mdash;he issued his orders of
march on November 9th; sent his last dispatch from
the interior to Washington, on the 11th; his army
was cut free from its former communications next day;
on the 14th it was concentrated at Atlanta; next day
two hundred acres of buildings, including all but the
private dwellings of the city were burned or blown
up; a Massachusetts brigade, its band playing the
wonderful "John Brown" folk-song, was the last to
leave the city; and with all the railroads effectually
ruined behind it, and a parting message to General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
Thomas that "All is well," all organized, provisioned,
and stripped down to the very last limit of impediments,
"the Lost Army" and its great leader set their
faces southward and disappeared from the sight of
their loyal countrymen for four weeks.</p>

<p>We cannot here repeat the well known and romantic
story of that Great March. With scarcely any serious
opposition, Sherman, an unsurpassed master
in the art of moving great armies, deluded what
few opponents there were, with feints and marches
on this side and on that, or brushed them away if
they stood, and pierced straight through the very
heart of the rebellion to Savannah; stormed Fort
McAllister, opened communication with the fleet, drove
Hardee out of Savannah, and presented the city and
25,000 bales of cotton, a "Christmas present" to President
Lincoln; then turning northward, resumed his
deadly way along the vitals of the confederacy, doing
exactly what he had foretold in his letter to Grant;
and sure enough, they did between them, "make short
work of Charleston and Richmond and the impoverished
coast of the Atlantic." The surrender of Lee
was quickly followed by that of Johnston, and except
for the small force which for a short time remained in
arms beyond the Mississippi, the rebellion was ended.</p>

<p>We cannot even give specimen extracts of the many
strongly and clearly worded papers written by General
Sherman during his military career, as general
orders, directions for the government of captured
places or property, or discussions of points of military
or civil law. But we must transcribe the noblest
compliment which the great soldier ever received; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
testimony of the colored clergyman, Rev. Garrison
Frazier, at Savannah, during the conferences there for
organizing the freedmen, to the merits of General
Sherman towards the race. Mr. Frazier said:</p>

<p>"We looked upon General Sherman prior to his arrival
as a man in the providence of God specially set
apart to accomplish this work, and we unanimously
feel inexpressible gratitude to him, looking upon him
as a man that should be honored for the faithful performance
of his duty. Some of us called on him immediately
upon his arrival, and it is probable <i>he would
not meet the Secretary with more courtesy than he met
us</i>. His conduct and deportment towards us characterized
him as a friend and a gentleman. We have
confidence in General Sherman, and think whatever
concerns us could not be under better management."</p>

<p>Of Sherman's characteristics as a general, we shall
also give one single trait illustrating the most wonderful
of them all&mdash;his almost divining foresight. We
have more than once showed how he foresaw only too
much for his own comfort; but in the present instance
he kept the matter to himself. It was, a preparation
when the war broke out for that very march which he
foretold in his letter to Grant and afterwards made.
This preparation consisted in his obtaining from the
Census Bureau at Washington a map of the "Cotton
States," with a table giving the latest census returns
of the cattle, horses and other products of each county
in them. On the basis of this he studied the South
for three years; and when the time for the march
came, he knew substantially the whole resources of
the country he was to pass through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
General Sherman's negotiations with Johnston, their
disapproval by Government, and his quarrel in consequence
with General Halleck and Secretary Stanton
were unfortunate; but it would be utterly absurd to
admit for a moment that his motives in what he did
were other than the very best; and his own explanation
of the affair shows that he was following out a
policy which would have been in full harmony with
President Lincoln's own feelings, as communicated to
Sherman on the subject.</p>

<p>Perhaps General Sherman may some day be selected
for some high civil office. He is a man perhaps only
of too lofty character and too brilliant genius to be
harnessed into political traces. He was once nominated
for something or other at San Francisco, but
when the "committee" came to tell him, he answered
sarcastically, "Gentlemen, I am not eligible; I am not
properly educated to hold office!" Col. Bowman observes,
"This nomination was the commencement of
his political career, and his reply was the end of it."
It is true in too many cases that a true soldier, like a
good citizen, will find his very virtues the insurmountable
obstacles to political success. This is perhaps likely
to remain the case unless the rule shall come into
vogue that nobody shall have an office who lets it be
known that he wants it.</p>

<p>The spirit of Christ is all love; it seeks only to
enhance the highest good of existence, and to give to
every being its utmost of happiness. The spirit of
war is all wrath. It seeks to destroy by violence, and
as fast as possible, whatever and whoever may oppose
it. These two principles would seem so diametrically
opposed to each other, that no man could be at once
a Christian and a soldier, any more than he could ride
at once on two horses going in opposite directions, or
turn his back on himself, and at once go forward and
backward. Indeed, the cases where the two professions
have been united are rare, and may probably
depend upon some uncommon conjunction of gifts.
But there certainly have been such. Colonel Gardiner
was one. General Havelock was another; and General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
Howard, who has been surnamed the Havelock of
America, is another.</p>

<p>Oliver Otis Howard was born in Leeds, Maine, Nov.
8th, 1830. His father was a thrifty and independent
farmer. The boy lived at home until he was ten,
when his father dying, an uncle, Hon. John Otis, of
Hallowell, took charge of him. He now attended
school, went through Bowdoin College, and then entered
the West Point Academy, graduating there in
1854, fourth in general standing of his class. Beginning,
as usual, as brevet second lieutenant, he was
assigned to the ordnance department; and in 1856
was chief ordnance officer in Florida, during a campaign
against the Indians there. He worked steadily
on in his profession, and at the beginning of the war
was assistant professor of mathematics at West Point,
and being desirous to accept the command of a volunteer
regiment from his own State, asked leave
from the War Department to do so, and was refused.
On this he resigned his commission, and the Governor
of Maine, in the end of May, 1861, appointed him
colonel of the Third Maine Volunteers, which was the
first three years' regiment from that State.</p>

<p>At Bull Run, he commanded a brigade, being senior
colonel on the field, and for good conduct there,
was in the following September commissioned brigadier-general
of volunteers. In December he was
placed in General Sumner's command; and he remained
in the Army of the Potomac until the latter part
of September, 1863, when, having risen to the command
of the Eleventh Army Corps, that and Slocum's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
corps, both under Hooker, were sent to reinforce the
army at Chattanooga.</p>

<p>During this time General Howard was present in all
the chief battles of the Army of the Potomac. At
Fair Oaks, on the Peninsula, he was twice wounded
in the right arm, and had to have his arm amputated;
but he got back in season for the next battle&mdash;that of
the second Bull Run. At Antietam, at Fredericksburg,
at Chancellorsville, he was present and fought his command
to the uttermost. At Gettysburg, Howard's
troops held the key of the position, the cemetery; and
a soldier who was in the field with him in that tremendous
fight, in speaking of his extreme calmness
and coolness under fire, said, "General Howard stood
there as if nothing at all was the matter. He never
takes stimulants, either. Most of the officers do, but
he never does. He was so calm because he was a
Christian." Colonel Bowman, in speaking of this
same trait in General Howard, testifies to the same
point; observing that he is "careless of exposing his
person in battle, to an extent that would be attributable
to rashness or fatalism if it were not known to
spring from religion."</p>

<p>During his campaigns with Sherman he was a most
trustworthy and serviceable commander; singularly
cool and fearless in battle, and most prompt and thorough
in the performance of whatever duty was imposed
upon him. After accompanying Sherman in
his march for the relief of Burnside, General Howard
served in the Atlanta campaign in command of the
Fourth Army Corps; after the death of General McPherson,
he succeeded him in the important command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
of the Army of the Tennessee; and in Sherman's
Great March, he was placed in command of the right
wing, one of the two into which Sherman's force was
divided, and in this position served until the end of
the war.</p>

<p>General Sherman quickly liked his trusty and helpful
subordinate, and has repeatedly paid high compliments
to his soldierly and moral excellence. At the
end of the Chattanooga campaign, for instance, in reporting
to Gen. Grant, he said, "In General Howard
throughout I found a polished and Christian gentleman,
exhibiting the highest and most chivalrous traits
of the soldier." Colonel Bowman speaks of General
Howard's practice of Christian observances in the
army with a curious sort of admiration which sufficiently
shows how uncommon it was, at least among
officers of high grade. He says:</p>

<p>"General Howard, it is well known, has been pious
and exemplary from his boyhood, was ever faithful
and devoted in the discharge of his religious duties,
and this even while a student at West Point. He carried
his religious principles with him into the army,
and was guided and governed by them in all his relations
with his officers and men. No matter who was
permitted to share his mess or partake of his repast,
whether the lowest subaltern of his command or General
Sherman himself, no one thought to partake, if
General Howard were present, without first the invocation
of the Divine blessing, himself usually leading,
like the father of a family. General Sherman seems
greatly to have admired the Christian character of
General Howard, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and not only as a Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
but as a soldier, preferring him and promoting
him to the command of one of his armies." President
Lincoln also valued him very highly, and was his immovable
friend.</p>

<p>General Howard's unconditional devotion to duty
was very strongly shown in the use he made of his
time while disabled from military duty just after the
loss of his arm. One of his companions in the service
has described <span class="locked">how&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Weak and fainting from hemorrhage and the severe
shock his system had sustained, the next day
he started for his home in Maine. He remained there
only two months, during which time he was not idle.
Visiting various localities in his native State, he made
patriotic appeals to the people to come forward and
sustain the government. Pale, emaciated, and with
one sleeve tenantless, he stood up before them, the
embodiment of all that is good and true and noble in
manhood. He talked to them as only one truly loyal
can talk&mdash;as one largely endowed with that patriotism
which is a heritage of New England blood. Modesty,
sincerity, and earnestness characterized his addresses,
and his fervent appeals drew hundreds of recruits
around the national standard."</p>

<p>Howard's reply to the swearing teamster was a good
instance of kind but decided reproof, of just the sort
that will do good if any will. The story is this:</p>

<p>"On one occasion, a wagon-master, whose teams
were floundering through the bottomless mud of a
Georgia swamp, became exasperated at the unavoidable
delay, and indulged in such a torrent of profanity
as can only be heard in the army or men of his class.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
General Howard quietly approached, unperceived by
the offender, and was an unwilling listener to the blasphemous
words. The wagon-master, on turning
around, saw his general in close proximity, and made
haste to apologize for his profane outburst, by saying,
'Excuse me, General, I did not know you were here.'
The General, looking a reprimand, replied, 'I would
prefer that you abstain from swearing from a higher
and better motive than because of my presence.'"</p>

<p>In May, 1865, General Howard was placed at the
head of the Freedmen's Bureau; a position for which
he was probably the very best man in the United
States, one whose extremely noble and benevolent
purpose was wholly in harmony with the loftiest traits
of his own character, and whose peculiar difficulties
were such as he was exactly the man to encounter, by
nature, education and official position.</p>

<p>By imagining one's self to have passed forward in
history for a century or two centuries, and to be taking
such a backward perspective view of the southern
rebellion as such an advance would give, any mind of
historic qualities will perceive more clearly than in
any other way the falling off and disappearance of the
minor circumstances of the great struggle, and the
few great features that remain&mdash;the central facts, the
real meanings of the war. Of all these, that which
will remain most important is, the escape from their
modern Egypt of the nation of the slaves. Lives and
deeds of individual men will grow obscure. The gigantic
battles, the terrific novelties, the vast campaigning
combinations of the successive chapters of the war
will lose their present strong colors. Even the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
part of the white population of the United States sought
in vain to sever their political union with the rest, will
lose its present foremost place in the story; for it will
have assumed the character of an abortive delusion; a
temporary struggle, whose pretended reasons were sophistical
and false, whose real ones were kept out of sight
as much as possible, and which ended in the speedy
re-establishment of the power attacked. But the
emancipation of the slaves is an eternal epoch; it
marks the point where the race of one vast continent,
after centuries of exile into another continent and of
the most degrading subjection to another race, is all
at once let out into civilization; brought forth from
the pens of beasts, to take a place among the sons of
men. Yet more; they are admitted to take a place
among the sons of God; for American slavery, as if
with the devil's own cunning and cruel power, did
really not only exclude the slave from becoming a citizen,
but it actually excluded him from the power of
becoming a Christian. The emancipation of the slaves
was even more than the organization of a new nation;
for it was the birth into humanity of a new race.</p>

<p>This view of the case is naturally even now not accepted
by large numbers of persons. It was a matter
of course that still larger numbers should fail to understand
it in the day of it. President Lincoln himself
apparently felt more hope than expectation upon the
subject; and all know how long he delayed, how unendurably
slow he seemed to far-sighted lovers of humanity,
before he issued his great proclamation. But
there are a few men, who possess at once a powerful
instinct of benevolence and an intuitive comprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
of the present and the future&mdash;qualities which
naturally go together, because they are alike pure, lofty,
dependent upon peculiarly noble organizations. As
soon as the progress of the war rendered any considerable
number of freedmen accessible for any permanently
useful purpose, societies began at once to be organized
in the North to help the freedman towards his
rightful standing of an intelligent Christian citizenship.
The first of them were organized in Boston, New York,
and Philadelphia, in consequence of the information
given by General Sherman, Commodore Dupont, and
the able Treasury Agent, Mr. E.&nbsp;L. Pierce, of the situation
of the freedmen on the Sea Islands of Georgia
and South Carolina. Several societies or "commissions"
were established, all of which&mdash;except some
ecclesiastical ones&mdash;are now operating in conjunction
as "The American Freedmen's Union Commission."
The "Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned
Lands," commonly called the Freedmen's Bureau, was
created by an act of Congress passed in March, 1865,
and in form received the freedmen into the express
protection and care of the Government; and its creation
was to a considerable extent if not altogether the
result of the efforts of the energetic men who had established
the various private commissions. It is possible
that the Bureau might have been earlier established,
had the right man been found to take charge
of it. When General Howard was thought of, at the
conclusion of the war, it was felt that he was in every
respect most suitable. His lofty views of duty; his
habits of orderly obedience and orderly command;
the facilities of his high military position for dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
with the body of assistants it was contemplated to
secure from the army; and above all, his calm, steady,
kindly ways, and his rare characteristic and complete
sympathy with the missionary object of securing a real
Christian citizenship for the unfortunate colored race,
were just the qualities that must have been put together
if a man was to have been constructed on purpose
for the place.</p>

<p>General Howard has been most earnestly at work in
this position ever since, amid great difficulties and obstructions,
but with unfailing faith and industry; and
although it is easy to see how far more of his great
task would have been at this day accomplished had the
white people of the South, and the Government itself
helped the Bureau earnestly and in good faith, yet
very great good has already been done.</p>

<p>Doubtless the freed people have in many things been
faulty. It would be strange indeed if a whole race
could in the twinkling of an eye, put off the bad habits
burned and ingrained into the very texture of their
bodies and minds, by a heavy tyranny of two centuries
and a half. Generations of freedom must pass before
the evils can wholly disappear that generations of
slavery have systematically and powerfully cultivated.
But already, to a very great degree (to use the words
of a recent comprehensive summary of the history of
the Bureau,) "labor has been reorganized, justice has
been secured, systems of education *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* have
been established, the transition period from slavery to
liberty has been safely passed, and the freed people
have emerged from their state of bondage into that of
the liberty of American citizenship."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
The operations of the Bureau and of the Commission
which works in union with it, as a sort of unofficial
counterpart&mdash;a draught-horse hitched on outside
the thills&mdash;have sought four objects for the freedmen,
in the following order: 1. To provide for their
temporal wants; for if they had no food for to-day,
and no clothes nor roofs to shelter them, they would
be out of the world before they could learn their
letters, earn a dollar, or learn to obey the law; 2.
To promote justice; 3. To reorganize labor; 4. To
provide education.</p>

<p>In his difficult and laborious position, General Howard
has had to act without the help of any public funds,
by using temporarily certain species of abandoned
property, and by means of details of officers and men
from the army, who have done their work in the
Bureau as part of their military duty, and without
other than their usual pay. The good accomplished
has been rather by the use of influence, by forbearance,
by the exercise of the minimum of absolute authority.
But in spite of the good intentions of Congress,
the help of the Government of the United States,
which, so far as its action upon the Freedmen's Bureau is
concerned, is exclusively the executive, has not in any
complete sense been given either to the freedmen themselves,
in their toilsome upward road, nor to those who
have been striving to aid them in the ascent; but it
has rather been felt as a cold, sullen and grudging
sufferance, verging even into a pretty distinct manifestation
of an enmity like that of the worse class of
unfriendly southern whites, and showing more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
one token of an intention to destroy the Bureau and
leave the freedmen helpless as soon as possible.</p>

<p>General Howard has done all that could be done,
against these obstacles. It is easy to see what constant
exercise he must need, of the Christian virtues of forbearance,
patience, kindness, and the overcoming of
evil with good, as well as of the moral qualities of
honor and justice, and the soldierly attainments of order,
promptitude and industry. With some of these
he must meet the angry tricks of white enemies; with
some, the pitiful faults&mdash;which are misfortunes rather&mdash;faults
of the freedmen themselves&mdash;idleness, falsehood,
dishonesty, disorder, incapacity, fickleness; with others
still, the inactive resistance of his superiors, and the
cumbrous machinery of an organization which the nature
of the case prevents from coming into good working
shape.</p>

<p>In spite of all obstacles, the Missionary General and
his Bureau and the Commission have done much. Up
to the first day of 1867, fourteen hundred schools had
been established, with sixteen hundred and fifty-eight
teachers and over ninety thousand pupils; besides 782
Sabbath Schools with over 70,000 pupils; and the
freedmen were then paying towards the support of
these schools, out of their own scanty earnings, after
the rate of more than eleven thousand dollars a month.
Within one year, they had accumulated in their savings
bank, $616,802.54. Many of them have bought
and possess homesteads of their own. Their universal
obedience to law would be remarkable in any community
in the world, and under such treatment as they
have experienced from their former masters since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
war, would have been simply impossible for the body
of freemen in the most law-abiding of the Northern
States. And above all, they are with one accord most
zealous, most diligent and most successful, in laboring
to obtain the religious and intellectual culture which
alone can fit them for their new position, as self-governing
citizens of a free country.</p>

<p>The views of intelligent army officers, of the task
which General Howard undertook in accepting this
post and of his fitness for it, are not without interest.
Col. Bowman thus describes the work:</p>

<p>"He was placed at the head of a species of Poor
Law Board, with vague powers to define justice and
execute loving kindness between four millions of
emancipated slaves and all the rest of mankind. He
was to be not exactly a military commander, nor yet
a judge of a Court of Chancery; but a sort of combination
of the religious missionary and school commissioner,
with power to feed and instruct, and this
for an empire half as large as Europe. But few officers
of the army would have had the moral courage
to accept such an appointment, and fewer still were as
well fitted to fill it and discharge one-half its complicated
and multifarious duties."</p>

<p>When General Howard, on accepting his new post,
advised his old commander by letter, General Sherman,
in a friendly reply, thus wrote:</p>

<p>"I hardly know whether to congratulate you or not,
but of one thing you may rest assured, that you possess
my entire confidence, and I cannot imagine that
matters that may involve the future of four millions
of souls could be put in more charitable and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
conscientious hands. So far as man can do, I believe
you will, but I fear you have Hercules' task. God
has limited the power of man, and though, in the kindness
of your heart, you would alleviate all the ills of
humanity, it is not in your power; nor is it in your
power to fulfill one-tenth part of the expectations of
those who framed the bureau for the freedmen, refugees
and abandoned estates. It is simply impracticable.
Yet you can and will do all the good one man may, and
that is all you are called on as a man and a Christian to
do; and to that extent count on me as a friend and
fellow-soldier for counsel and assistance." General
Sherman more than once repeated to others similar
testimonies of his faith in General Howard.</p>

<p>General Howard has not the vast intellect and brilliant
genius of General Sherman, nor the massive
strength and immense tenacious will of General Grant.
But he has qualities which are even loftier; namely,
those which are the sure basis for such respect and
confidence as General Sherman's; which alone have
enabled him to accomplish what he has in an enterprise
wholly discouraging on any merely human principles.
Grant and Sherman, in what they have done,
had at their backs a people far more intelligent, resolute
and wealthy, than those against whom they warred;
but a man like Howard, whose soul opens upward and
takes in the unselfish strength and love and faith of
Almighty God, can do great things for humanity irrespective
of money and majorities.</p>

<p>In writing the history of men of our time, we feel
that we are only making a selection of a few from
among many. We have given the character of one
State Governor&mdash;we could give many more, but must
confine ourselves to only two examples. William Alfred
Buckingham, for eight years Governor of Connecticut,
and under whose administration the State
passed through the war, may be held a worthy representative
of the wisdom, energy and patriotism of our
state magistracy in the time of the great trials.</p>

<p>Gov. Buckingham is of the strictest old Puritan
stock. The first of the name in this country was
Thomas Buckingham, one of the colony that planted
New Haven, Conn., but who soon removed to Milford
in that State, where he was one of the "Seven Pillars"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
of the church there, as originally organized. His
son, Rev. Thos. Buckingham, was minister of Saybrook,
one of the founders of Yale College, and one of the
moderators of the Synod that framed the "Saybrook
Platform." Through this branch of the family, this
Governor of Connecticut is descended, his father having
been born in Saybrook.</p>

<p>William Alfred Buckingham, the son of Samuel and
Joanna (Matson) Buckingham, was born in Lebanon,
Conn., May 28, 1804. His father was a thrifty farmer,
a deacon in the church, a man of remarkably sound
judgment and common sense, and a public spirited
man, abounding in hospitality. His mother was one
of those women in whom the strong qualities of the
Puritan stock come to a flowering and fruitage of a
celestial quality, a rare union of strength and soundness.
She had a mother's ambition for her children,
but always directed to the very highest things. "Whatever
else you are, I want you to be Christians," was
one of her daily household sayings. Her memory is
cherished in the records of many words and deeds of
love and beneficence, written not with ink and pen,
"but in fleshy tables of the heart," in all the region
where she lived.</p>

<p>The little town of Lebanon, like many others of the
smaller New England towns, had a fine Academy, which
enjoyed the culture of some of those strong and spicy
old New England school masters, that were a generation
worthy of more praise and celebration than the
world knows of. For that reason perhaps, this little
town of Lebanon has given to the State of Connecticut
five Governors, who have held that State office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
for 37 years out of the past one hundred&mdash;more than
one-third of the century.</p>

<p>Governor Buckingham's education was a striking
specimen of New England. It was based first on the
soil, in the habits and associations of a large, thriving,
well conducted farm. It was nourished up at those
rural Academies, which are fountain memorials of
the enthusiasm for education, of our Puritan fathers.
He had a special taste for mathematics, which, united
with the promptings of a vigorous and energetic physical
nature, and love of enterprise, led him to desire
the profession of a practical surveyor, a profession
which in those days had some state patronage, and
was attractive to young men of that class of character.
At the age of eighteen, he taught district
school, in Lyme, and gave such satisfaction
that his services were earnestly sought for another
year. He returned, however, to the practical labors
of his father's farm, and for the last three years performed
as much work as any of the laborers whom his
father hired. His nature seemed to incline him rather
to a dealing with the practical and physical forces of the
world, and so he wisely forbore that classical career
which would have occupied four years of his life in a
college, and began the career of a man of business at
once, entering a dry goods store in Norwich as clerk,
at twenty. After two years spent there, and a short
experience in a wholesale store in New York, he established
himself in business as a dry goods merchant
at Norwich, Conn. From this time his career has been
a successful one in the business circles of the country.
Enterprise, prudence, thrift, order and exact punctuality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
and spotless integrity have given him a name
worth any amount of money. In 1830 he commenced
the manufacture of ingrain carpeting, which he continued
for 18 years. In 1848 he closed up his dry
goods business, discontinued the manufacturing of carpeting,
and engaged in the fabrication of India Rubber,
a business then in its infancy.</p>

<p>From that time to the present, he has been the
treasurer, and an active business director of the
Hayward Rubber Company, a company located in Colchester,
which has prosecuted an extensive and successful
business. He is now a stockholder in eight or
ten manufacturing companies, to the general management
of quite a number of which he gives his attention.</p>

<p>An important feature in his character in these relations
is his great business accuracy and punctuality.
With an extended business running through a period
of forty years, only two notes drawn, were protested
for non-payment, and these cases occurred when he
was wholly disabled from business by sickness. It
was his custom always to remit money to meet notes
due in New York, three days before their maturity.
He has always regarded himself as under obligations
to pay his debts <i>at the time</i> agreed upon, as much as
to pay the amount due.</p>

<p>His unvarying and unfailing accuracy in these respects,
had given him a character which enabled him
at any time to command the assistance of any bank
with which he did business. His name was good
for any amount of resources. This particular characteristic
made his position as Governor of Connecticut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
in the sudden crisis of the war, of vital value to
the country.</p>

<p>No man could so soon command those material resources
which are the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine qua non</i> of war, and it is
one of many good Providences that the state of Connecticut
at this crisis was so manned. Immediately
on the news of the war, the banks of the state, and
business men in all parts, sent immediate and prompt
word to him that he might command their utmost
resources. They were even anxious to have their
capital at once made serviceable in the emergency,
and they felt sure in doing so that they were putting
their resources into the hands of a leader every way
fitted to employ them to the best advantage.</p>

<p>Governor Buckingham is well known as an exemplary
and laborious Christian, a devoted friend of education,
a practical and consistent temperance man,
and proverbially generous in his charities towards these,
and every other good cause. And it has probably
been due to this, as much as to his personal and official
integrity, that he has been so popular with his friends,
and claimed such respect from his political opponents.
Indeed nothing could have been more respectful and
generous, during all those excited political canvasses
which belonged to his public life, than the treatment
his private character received from those who were
politically opposed to him.</p>

<p>His own strict attention to the proprieties and
courtesy's of life, his bland and urbane manners
may go a long way towards accounting for this
result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
In 1830 he united with the Second Congregational
Church, under the care of Rev. Alfred Mitchell, and
in 1838 made a report to the Ecclesiastical Society, to
show the necessity of organizing a new church. Such
a church was organized four years after, and is now
known as the Broadway Congregational Church. From
its organization to the present time, he has been
one of its deacons, an active member, and a liberal
supporter. He gave them a fine organ when their
present church building was completed, and has lately
erected a beautiful chapel for one of their Mission Sabbath
Schools. He has himself been a Sabbath School
Teacher for the last thirty-seven years, except during
the four years of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>He was moderator of the National Congregational
Council held in Boston, in 1865.</p>

<p>As a friend of Education, he earnestly advocated the
consolidation of the School Districts of Norwich, and
a system of graded schools to be open to all, and supported
by a tax on property, and he was permitted to
see such a system established with the most beneficial
results. He was deeply interested in the effort to
establish the Norwich Free Academy, gave his personal
efforts to obtain a fund for its endowment, and
has contributed an amount to that fund second only
to one subscriber.</p>

<p>Having seen the extended and beneficial influence
which Yale College has exerted and is exerting over
the political and religious interest of the country, he
has felt it a privilege and a duty to contribute largely
to the pecuniary necessities of that institution.</p>

<p>He has given a permanent fund to the Broadway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
Congregational Church in Norwich, and to the Congregational
Church in Lebanon, with which his
parents and sisters were connected, the income of
which is to be used for the pastor's library. Joseph
Otis, Esq., who founded a public library in Norwich,
selected him for one of the trustees, and he is now
President of the Board.</p>

<p>As a politician, he was a Whig. In 1842 he was
the candidate of that party for a seat in the lower
house of the General Assembly, but was not elected.
He was afterwards repeatedly nominated both for the
House of Representatives and for the Senate, but declined
such nominations, and was never a member of a
legislative body. He has, however, frequently accepted
municipal offices; was often elected a member of
the City Council, sometimes occupying the seat of an
alderman, and was elected Mayor of the city of Norwich
in 1849 and 1850, and again in the years 1856
and 1857. When the Whig party was broken up, he
placed himself with the Republicans, and in 1858 was
elected Governor of the State, which position he occupied
eight years, and four of them were the years of
the Rebellion.</p>

<p>The famous Peace Conference met at Washington
one month before the inauguration of Lincoln, wherein
were represented thirteen of the free States and
seven of the slave States, for the purpose of considering
what could be done to pacify the excited
feelings of the South, and preserve the existing
Union.</p>

<p>Governor Buckingham was not a member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
conference, but appointed the commissioners from
Connecticut. He was in Washington during its session,
and in daily intercourse with members of that
body from all parts of the country, and understood
their views of questions at issue. But from the very
first he was of opinion that the state of things had
reached a place where further compromise was an
impossibility, or in the words of Lincoln, the Union
must now become either in effect all for slavery or all
for freedom in its general drift. So this peace conference
broke up, effecting nothing.</p>

<p>When the news of the fall of Sumter reached Connecticut,
attended by the Presidential call for troops,
the State Legislature was not in session. Governor
Buckingham, however, had such wide financial relations
as enabled him immediately to command the
funds for equipping the militia for the field.</p>

<p>From every quarter came to him immediate offers
both of money and of personal services, from men of
the very first standing in the State&mdash;and Connecticut,
we think, may say with honest pride that no men
went into the field better equipped, more thoroughly
appointed and cared for. Governor Buckingham gave
himself heart and soul to the work. During that perilous
week when Washington stood partially isolated
from the North, by the uprising of rebellion in Maryland,
Governor Buckingham, deeply sympathizing
with the President, dispatched his son-in-law, Gen.
Aiken, who with great enterprize and zeal found his
way through the obstructed lines to Washington, carrying
the welcome news to the President that Connecticut
was rising as one man, and that all her men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
all her wealth to the very last would be at the disposal
of the country.</p>

<p>The account of Gen. Aiken's trip to Washington
with the dispatches for the government there, brings
freshly to mind the intense excitement of those days,
and it contains some very striking touches of description
of the state of things at Washington. Gen. Aiken
left Norwich at 6 A.&nbsp;M., on Monday, April 22d,
1861; on reaching Philadelphia that evening, found
that city extremely stirred up, and all regular communication
with Washington suspended; met a gentleman
who wished to reach Washington, and the two
spent most of the night in searching for the means of
proceeding. At four next morning they got permission
to set out on a special train with a Pennsylvania regiment,
and after a very slow journey, in consequence
of the danger of finding the track torn up, reached
Perryville, on the Susquehanna, at ten. Gen. Butler
had carried off the ferry-boats to Annapolis; and after
delay and search, our two travellers hired a skiff and
crossed to Havre de Grace, where they found, not
only that the town was full of reports of railroads and
telegraphs broken up in all directions, but that there
were plenty of men watching to see how many
"d&mdash;d Yankees," as they called them, were going towards
Washington. Gen. Aiken and his friend, however,
after a time, chartered a covered wagon and
rode to Baltimore, arriving about 9 1&ndash;2 P.&nbsp;M. The
streets were brilliantly lighted, and full of people,
some of them in uniform, and most of them wearing
rebel badges; and even the few words which the
travellers heard as they passed along the crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
halls of their hotel, apprized them that no man could
avow Unionism there and preserve his life in safety
for a moment. They accordingly went at once to
their rooms and kept out of sight until morning, when
the hotel proprietor, a personal friend of Gen. Aiken's
companion, and also of the leading Baltimore rebels,
procured them passes signed by Gen. Winder and
countersigned by Marshal Kane. Having these, they
paid $50 for a carriage which took them to Washington.
Reaching Washington at 10 P.&nbsp;M. on Wednesday,
Gen. Aiken found its silence and emptiness a
startling contrast to the hot-blooded crowd at Baltimore.
He says:</p>

<p>"Half a dozen people in the hall of the hotel
crowded around <i>to ask questions about the North</i>. I
then began to realize the isolation of the city." Hurrying
to Gen. Scott's head-quarters, the old chief was
found with only two of his staff. "Upon reading the
Governor's letter, he rose and said excitedly, 'Sir,
you are the first man I have seen with a written dispatch
for three days. I have sent men out every day
to bring intelligence of the northern troops. Not one
of them has returned; where <i>are</i> the troops?' The
number and rapidity of his questions, and his very
excited manner, gave me a further realization of the
critical nature of the situation."</p>

<p>Calling on Secretary Cameron, Gen. Aiken was received
very much in the same manner. A friend in
one of the Departments "advised very strongly against
a return by the same route, <i>as my arrival was known</i>,
and the general nature of my business suspected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
rebel spies, with whom the city abounded, and in
some quarters least suspected.</p>

<p>"How the knowledge of my affairs could have
been gained has always been a mystery, for I had realized
since leaving Philadelphia, that my personal
safety depended entirely upon secrecy and prudence.</p>

<p>"At 10 A.&nbsp;M. I called on the President, and saw
him for the first time in my life. It was an interview
I can never forget. No office-seekers were about 'the
presence' that day&mdash;there was no delay in getting an
audience. Mr. Lincoln was alone, seated in his business
room up stairs, looking toward Arlington Heights
through a widely opened window. Against the casement
stood a very long spy-glass, which he had obviously
just been using. I gave him all the information
I could, from what I had seen and heard during my
journey.</p>

<p>"He seemed depressed beyond measure, as he asked,
slowly, and with great emphasis, 'What <i>is</i> the
North about? Do they know our condition?' I said,
'No, they certainly did not when I left.' This was
true enough.</p>

<p>"He spoke of the non-arrival of the troops under
Gen. Butler, and of having had no intelligence from
them for two or three days. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"I have referred to the separation of the city from
the North. In no one of many ways was it brought
home more practically to my mind than in this: The
funds in my possession were in New York city bank
notes. Their value in Washington had suddenly and
totally departed. They were good for their weight in
paper, and no more. During my interview with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
President, my financial dilemma was referred to. I
remarked that I had not a cent, although my pockets
were full. He instantly perceived my meaning, and
kindly put me in possession of such an amount of
specie as I desired. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Having delivered my
dispatch, and the Governor's words of encouragement,
and enjoyed an interview protracted, by the President's
desire, beyond ordinary length, I left."</p>

<p>The New York Seventh Regiment reached the city
just as Gen. Aiken had walked from the President's
house to the State Department; and when the flag
announcing their arrival at the Baltimore station was
hoisted, says Gen. Aiken, "such a stampede of humanity,
loyal and rebel, as was witnessed that hour
in the direction of the Baltimore Railway station, can
only be imagined by those who, like myself, took part
in it. One glance at the gray jackets of the Seventh
put hope in the place of despondency in my breast."</p>

<p>Gen. Aiken returned by taking a private conveyance,
and obscure roads, until, north of the Pennsylvania
line, he reached a railroad, and at Hanover, the
first telegraph station, reported progress to Governor
Buckingham, having been unable to communicate
with him during four days, and not having seen the
United States flag once during the whole trip from
Philadelphia around to the Pennsylvania line, except
on the Capitol at Washington. Gen. Aiken, in concluding
his account, says, undoubtedly with correctness,
"There has been no hour since that when
messages of sympathy, encouragement and aid
from the loyal Governor of a loyal State were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
truly needed or more effective upon the mind of our
late President, than those I had the honor to deliver."</p>

<p>The views of Governor Buckingham as to the policy
to be pursued with the rebellion may best be learned
from the following letter, which he addressed to the
President, dated June 25th, 1861:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;The condition of our government is so critical
that the people of this State are looking with
deep interest to measures which you may recommend
to Congress, and to the course which that body may
pursue when it shall convene on the 4th day of July
next.</p>

<p>"You will not therefore think me presuming if I
present for your consideration the views entertained
by a large majority of our citizens, especially when I
assure you that if they are not approved by your
judgment, I shall regard it as evidence that their
importance is over-estimated.</p>

<p>"There are to-day probably more than three hundred
thousand men organized, armed and in rebellion
against the general government. Millions of other
citizens, who have been protected by its power, now
deny its authority, and refuse obedience to its laws.
Multitudes of others, who prize the blessings which
they have received under its policy, are so overawed
by the manifestations of passionate violence which
surround them, that their personal security is found in
suppressing their opinions, and floating with the current
into the abyss of anarchy. The person and
property and liberty of every citizen are in peril. This
is no ordinary rebellion. It is a mob on a gigantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
scale, and should be met and suppressed by a power
corresponding with its magnitude.</p>

<p>"The obligations of the government to the loyal,
the principles of equity and justice, the claims of humanity,
civilization and religion, unite in demanding a
force sufficient to drive the rebels from every rendezvous,
to influence them to return to their homes and
their lawful employments, to seize their leaders and
bring them before the proper tribunals for trial, and
to inflict upon them the punishment justly due for
their crimes. In your message to Congress I trust
you will ask for authority to organize and arm a force
of four or five hundred thousand men, for the purpose
of quelling the rebellion, and for an appropriation
from the public treasury sufficient for their support.
Let legislation upon every other subject be regarded
as out of time and place, and the one great object
of suppressing the rebellion be pursued by the
administration with vigor and firmness, without taking
counsel of our fears, and without listening to any
proposition or suggestion which may emanate from
rebels or their representatives, until the authority of
the government shall be respected, its laws enforced,
and its supremacy acknowledged in every section of
our country.</p>

<p>This gallant and spirited letter shows conclusively
that if the first one or two years of the war trailed
on in irresolution and defeat, it was not for want of
decided spirit in Connecticut and her governor.</p>

<p>Still later in the war, we find Governor Buckingham
addressing the following to President Lincoln, in view
of his projected Emancipation Policy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
"<span class="smcap">State of Connecticut, Executive Department</span>,<br />
<span class="l2"><span class="smcap">Hartford</span>, Sept. 26, 1862.</span>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;While my views of your Proclamations
issued on the 22d and 24th instants, may be of
little or no importance, yet you will permit me to congratulate
you and the country that you have so clearly
presented the policy which you will hereafter pursue
in suppressing the rebellion, and to assure you that it
meets my cordial approval, and shall have my unconditional
support.</p>

<p>"Not that I think your declaration of freedom will
of itself bring liberty to the slave, or restore peace to
the nation; but I rejoice that your administration will
not be prevented by the clamors of men in sympathy
with rebels, from using such measures as you indicate
to overpower the rebellion, even if it interferes with
and overthrows their much loved system of slavery.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span></p>
<p>"Have we not too long deluded ourselves with the
idea that mild and conciliatory measures would influence
them to return to their allegiance? They have
appealed to the arbitrament of the sword; why should
we hesitate to use the sword, and press the cause to a
decision? Have we not undervalued their resources,
disbelieved in their deep hatred of our government
and its free institutions; and, influenced by erroneous
ideas of the principles of humanity and mercy, criminally
sent our brave sons down to the grave by thousands,
without having given them the coveted honor
of falling on the battle-field, or without having changed
in the least the purpose of our enemies.</p>

<p>"This little State has already sent into the army,
and has now at the rendezvous more than one-half of
her able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen
and forty-five years, and has more to offer, if wanted,
to contend in battle against the enemies of our government.</p>

<p>"I trust we shall press with increased energy and
power every war measure, as the most economical,
humane and Christian policy which can be adopted to
save our national union, as well as to secure permanent
peace to those who shall succeed us.</p>

After eight years of public service, five of which
were made arduous by this war, into which, as may
be seen by these letters, Governor Buckingham threw
his whole heart and soul, and in which he bore equally
with our good President, the burdens of the country,
he retired at last to that more private sphere which
he fills with so many forms of honorable usefulness.</p>

<p>We have but one anecdote in closing, a noble tribute
to the Governor's blameless example in his high
station.</p>

<p>The Connecticut Election Day, as it is called, or the
day when the Legislature assembles, and the Governor
is inaugurated, has always been held in the State as a
grand gala day. During the war, especially, the military
pomp and parade was often very imposing. The
Governor's military staff consists of eight or ten members,
and while the war lasted hard work and responsible
duties fell to their lot. A friend of the Governor
who had usually been with him on these occasions,
remarked to one of his staff at the last of them:</p>

<p>"I have often been with you on these occasions,
and have never seen any liquor drank. I suppose,"
he added pleasantly, "you do that privately."</p>

<p>"No, sir;" was the reply. "None of the Governor's
staff ever use liquor."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" was the surprised reply.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer&mdash;"it is so."</p>

<p>Such an example as this, in so high a place, had a
value that could not be too highly estimated.</p>

<p>Wendell Phillips was born in Boston, Mass., Nov.
29, 1811.</p>

<p>He is son of John Phillips, first Mayor of Boston.
The Phillips family justly rank among the untitled aristocracy
of Massachusetts. Liberal views, noble manners,
love of learning and benevolent liberality have
become in that state associated with the name.</p>

<p>John Phillips, the grand uncle of Wendell Phillips,
was the founder of Exeter Academy, in New Hampshire.
Besides this he endowed a professorship in
Dartmouth College, and contributed liberally to Princeton
College, and gave $31,000 to Phillips Academy in
Andover.</p>

<p>His nephew Samuel Phillips, planned, founded and
organized Phillips Academy in Andover. He was a
member of the provincial Congress during the Revolutionary
war&mdash;a member of the convention to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
the United States Constitution in 1779, and a State
Senator for twenty years following the adoption of
the constitution, and for fifteen years was president in
the Senate, and was from first to last the particular and
trusted friend of Gen. Washington. If there be such
a thing in America as a just and proper aristocracy it
inheres in families in whom public virtues and services
have been as eminent as in this case.</p>

<p>Wendell Phillips was a graduate of Harvard College
in 1831, and at the Cambridge law school in 1833,
and was admitted to the Suffolk bar in 1834.</p>

<p>A precise and elegant scholar, gifted with all possible
advantages of family, position, and prestige,
Wendell Phillips began life with every advantage.
But the very year after his admission to the bar, he
was a witness of the mob in which Garrison was
dragged disgracefully through Boston, for the crime
of speaking his conscientious opinions.</p>

<p>The spirit of his Puritan fathers was strong within
him&mdash;and he was acting in accordance with all his
family traditions when he at once espoused the cause
of Liberty.</p>

<p>His earliest public speech was made on an occasion
befitting a son of old Massachusetts.</p>

<p>On November 7, 1837, the Rev. E.&nbsp;P. Lovejoy, was
shot by a mob at Alton, Illinois, while attempting to
defend his printing press from destruction. When
news of this event was received in Boston, Dr. Channing
headed a petition to the Mayor and Aldermen
asking the use of Faneuil Hall for a public meeting.
It will scarcely be credited by the present generation
that a request so reasonable and so natural, headed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
a name so commanding as that of Dr. Channing, should
have been flatly refused. The Mayor and Aldermen
of Boston in those days trembled before the rod of
southern masters, and however well disposed towards
their own distinguished citizens, dared not encourage
them in the expression of any sentiments which
might possibly be disagreeable to the South. It
is true that this was the third printing press which
Lovejoy had attempted to defend. It is true that he
had a perfect legal right in his own state of Illinois to
print whatever he chose. It is true also that the rioters
who came from Missouri and attacked his house
and shot him, were the vilest and profanest scum of
society which a slave state can breed; but for all that, the
State of Massachusetts at that time could scarcely find
a place or a voice to express indignation at the outrage.
Dr. Channing, undismayed by the first rebuff,
addressed an impressive letter to his fellow citizens
which resulted in a meeting of influential gentlemen
at the old court room. Here measures were taken to
secure a much larger number of names to the petition.
This time the Mayor and Aldermen consented.</p>

<p>The meeting was held on the 8th of December, and
organized with the Hon. Jonathan Phillips for chairman.
Dr. Channing opened the meeting with an eloquent
address, and resolutions drawn up by him were
read and offered.</p>

<p>The attorney general of Massachusetts appeared now
as the advocate of the rioters. He compared the slaves
to a menagerie of wild beasts, and the Alton rioters
to the orderly mob who threw the tea overboard in
1773&mdash;talked of the "conflict of laws" between Missouri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
and Illinois, declared that Lovejoy was presumptuous
and imprudent and died as the fool dieth. Then
with direct and insulting reference to Dr. Channing,
he asserted that a clergyman with a gun in his hand, or
one mingling in the debates of a popular assembly,
were equally out of place. This speech produced, as
was natural, a sensation in Faneuil Hall, and Wendell
Phillips who had come without expecting to speak, rose
immediately to his feet and amid the boisterous efforts
of the mobocratic party in the house to drown his voice
made his first public speech.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillip's style of oratory is peculiarly solemn and
impressive. The spirit of whole generations of Puritan
ministers seems to give might to it. There is no
attempt to propitiate prejudice&mdash;none to throw out
popular allurements&mdash;it is calm, intense, and commanding.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, in the course of this speech, "when I
heard the gentleman lay down principles which place
the murderers of Alton side by side with Otis and
Hancock, with Quincy and Adams, I thought those
precious lips, (pointing to the portraits in the hall)
would have broken into voices to rebuke the recreant
American; the slanderer of the dead. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Sir, for the sentiments that he has uttered, on soil consecrated
by the prayers of the Puritans and the blood
of patriots, the earth should have yawned and swallowed
him up."</p>

<p>A storm of mingled applause and hisses interrupted
the bold young orator&mdash;with cries of "take that back&mdash;take
that back." The uproar became so great for a
time that he could not be heard. One or two gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
came to Mr. Phillips' side while the crowd still
continued to shout. "Make him take that back&mdash;he
sha'nt go on till he takes that back." Mr. Phillips came
forward to the edge of the platform, and looking on
the excited multitude with that calm, firm, severe
bearing-down glance which seems often to have such
mesmeric effects, said solemnly:</p>

<p>"Fellow citizens, I cannot take back my words.
Surely the attorney general so long and well known
here, needs not the aid of your hisses against one so
young as I am&mdash;my voice, never before heard in your
walls." After this the young orator was heard to the
end of his speech without interruption. In this first
speech, which was wholly unpremeditated, he showed
all that clearness, elegance of diction, logical compactness,
and above all, that weight of moral conviction
which characterized all his subsequent oratory.</p>

<p>In allusion to the speech of the attorney general he
said: "<i>Imprudent!</i> to defend the liberty of the press!
Why? Because the defence was unsuccessful! Does
success gild crime into patriotism and the want of it
change heroic self-devotion into imprudence? Was
Hampden imprudent when he drew the sword and
threw away the scabbard? Yet he, judged by that
single hour, was unsuccessful. After a short exile the
race he hated sat again upon the throne.</p>

<p>"Imagine yourselves present when the first news of
Bunker Hill battle reached a New England town. The
tale would have run thus: 'The patriots are routed&mdash;the
red coats victorious&mdash;Warren lies dead upon the
field.' With what scorn would that Tory have been received
who should have charged Warren with imprudence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
who should have said that 'bred a physician, he
was out of place, and died as the fool dieth.' How
would the intimation have been received that Warren
and his successors should have waited a better time?'</p>

<p>"<i>Presumptuous!</i> to assert the freedom of the press
on American ground! Is the assertion of such freedom
before the age? So much before the age as to
leave no one a right to make it because it displeases
the community? Who invented this libel on his country?
It is this very thing which entitled Lovejoy to
greater praise. The disputed right which provoked
the revolution was far beneath that for which he died.
(Here was a strong and general expression of disapprobation.)
One word, gentlemen. As much as
thought is better than money, so much is the cause
in which Lovejoy died nobler than a mere question of
taxes. James Otis thundered in this hall when the
King did but touch his <i>pocket</i>. Imagine if you can,
his indignant eloquence if England had offered to put
a gag on his lips. Mr. Chairman, from the bottom
of my heart I thank that brave little band at Alton
for resisting. We must remember that Lovejoy had
fled from city to city&mdash;suffering the destruction of
three printing presses patiently. At length he took
counsel with friends, men of character, of tried integrity,
of wide views of Christian principle. They
thought the crisis had come&mdash;that it was full time
to assert the laws. They saw around them, not a
community like our own, of fixed habits and character,
but one in the gristle, not yet hardened in
the bone of manhood. The people there, children
of our older States, seem to have forgotten the blood-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>tried
principles of their fathers, the moment they
lost sight of New England hills. Something was
to be done to show them the priceless value of freedom
of the press, to bring back and set right their
wandering and confused ideas. He and his advisers
looked on a community, struggling like a drunken
man, indifferent to their rights and confused in their
feelings. Deaf to argument, haply they might be
stunned into sobriety. They saw that of which we
cannot judge, the <i>necessity</i> of resistance. Insulted law
called for it. Public opinion, fast hastening on the
downward course, must be arrested. Does not the
event show they judged rightly? Absorbed in a
thousand trifles, how will the nation all at once come
to a stand? Men begin as in 1776 and 1640 to discuss
principles and weigh characters, to find out where
they are. Haply we may awake before we are borne
over the precipice."</p>

<p>From this time Wendell Phillips was identified with
the radical abolitionists.</p>

<p>His nature is characterized by an extreme ideality.
He is essentially in all things a purist. Had he
not thus early in life been absorbed by the exigencies
of a moral conflict, Mr. Phillips would have shown
himself one of the most thorough and carefully cultivated
men of literature in our country. The demand
for perfection is one of the most rigorous in his nature,
and would have shown itself in an exacting precision
in style, orthography, rhetoric and pronunciation.
In regard to all these things his standard is that
of an idealist. But the moral nature derived from his
Puritan ancestry, was stronger than every other portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
of him, and his ideality became concentrated
upon the existing conflict in American society. His
nature led him at once to take the most strenuous
and rigorous ground side by side with William Lloyd
Garrison.</p>

<p>Tried by his severe standard, the constitution of the
United States, by an incidental complicity with slavery,
had become a sinful compact: a covenant with
death and an agreement with hell&mdash;and with the unquestioning
consistency which belonged to his Puritan
blood, he did not hesitate to sacrifice to this belief his
whole professional future.</p>

<p>He abandoned his legal practice and took leave of
the Suffolk bar, because he could not conscientiously
take the oath to support the Constitution of the United
States. What things were gain to him he counted
loss.</p>

<p>Henceforth there was no career open to him but
that of the agitator and popular reformer. He
brought to the despised and unfashionable cause not
only the prestige of one of the most honored Massachusetts
names, and the traditions of a family which was
among orthodox circles as a Hebrew of the Hebrews,
but the power of decidedly the first forensic orator
that America has ever produced. His style was so
dazzling, so brilliant, his oratory so captivating, that
even the unpopularity of his sentiments could not prevent
the multitudes from flocking to hear him. He
had in a peculiar degree that mesmeric power of control
which distinguishes the true orator, by which he
holds a multitude subject to his will, and carries them
whither he pleases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
His speeches were generally extempore, and flowed
on with a wonderful correctness, and perfect finish
of language, without faltering, without the shadow
of an inelegance&mdash;his sentences succeeding one another
with a poised and rhythmical fullness, and his illustrations
happily running through the field of ancient
and modern history, and with the greatest apparent
ease selecting whatever he needed from thence for the
illustration of his subject. In invective no American
or English orator has ever surpassed him. At the bar of
his fervid oratory he would arraign, try and condemn
with a solemn and dignified earnestness that might almost
have persuaded the object of his attack of his
own guilt. Warren Hastings is said to have judged
himself to be the basest of men while he listened to
the denunciations of Burke, and something of the
same experience may have befallen those who were
arraigned by Phillips.</p>

<p>There was need enough at this time for a man thus
endowed to come to the help of liberty in America,
for the creeping influence of the despotic South, lulling,
caressing, patronizing, promising, threatening and
commanding, had gone very nigh to take away the
right of free inquiry and free speech through the
whole Northern States.</p>

<p>The few noble women, who formed the original
Boston Anti-Slavery Society, were a mark everywhere
spoken against. Even after the stormy and scurrilous
attack of the mob which drove them out from their
meeting, and which almost took the life of Garrison,
there was not a newspaper in Boston, except the Liberator,
which did not, in giving an account of the matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
blame the abolitionists instead of the rioters. It was
the old story that the lamb had troubled the wolf, and
ought to be eaten up forthwith. The Advertiser spoke
of the affair, "not so much as a riot, as the prevention
of a riot," and "considered the whole matter as the
triumph of law over lawless violence, and the love of
order over riot and confusion." The Christian Register
recommended to the ladies to imitate the early
Christians of Trajan's day, and meet in secret, adding,
with a sneer, "if the <i>vanity</i> of the ladies would allow."</p>

<p>A leading orthodox divine shortly after preached a
sermon to illustrate and defend the doctrine that no
man has a right to promulgate any opinion distasteful
to the majority of society where he lives. All, in
short, seemed to be going one way&mdash;newspapers, pulpits,
bar and bench, and the gay world of fashion,
were alike agreed that if discussing the condition and
rights and wrongs of the slave, was disagreeable to
southern people it ought to be put a stop to at once
and everywhere, and that the Abolitionists were a
pestilent sect, who turned the world upside down.</p>

<p>In Wendell Phillips, at last, the scornful world met
its match, for he was fully capable of meeting scorn
with superior scorn, and retorting on contempt with
contempt, and he stood as high above the fear of man
that bringeth a snare, as any of the most unworldly
of his Puritan grandfathers.</p>

<p>The little band of Abolitionists that gathered around
him and Garrison, men and women, were every one
of them heroes. They were of the old revolutionary
stock of Boston, and every way worthy of their lineage,
and there was need enough it should be so, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
the struggle was no inconsiderable one&mdash;it was for life
and death. Cast out of society, looked on as the off-scouring
of the earth, hemmed in everywhere with
slanders, often alienated from friends once the dearest
and most admiring, laboring almost alone with an incessant
and exhausting zeal, some of more delicate
organization sunk under the trial, and may be said to
have given their lives to the cause.</p>

<p>Wendell Phillips speaks of them feelingly in one of
his later speeches, delivered on the anniversary of the
Boston Mob:</p>

<p>"Many of those who met in this hall at that time
are gone. They died as Whittier well <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Their brave hearts breaking slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But self-forgetful to the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In words of cheer and bugle glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their breath upon the darkness past.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>"In those days, as we gathered around their graves,
and resolved that the narrower the circle became the
closer we would draw together, we envied the dead
their rest. Men ceased to slander them in that sanctuary;
and as we looked forward to the desolate vista
of calamity and trial before us, and thought of the
temptations which beset us on either side, from worldly
prosperity which a slight sacrifice of principle might
secure, or social ease so close at hand, by only a little
turning aside, we almost envied the dead the quiet
sleep to which we left them&mdash;the harvest reaped, and
the seal set beyond the power of change."</p>

<p>The career of Phillips in those days was often amid
threats of personal violence. Assassination, the favorite
argument of slavery, was held up before him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
the recent death of Lovejoy showed that the threat
was not an empty one. At home, his house, in turn
with that of other leading abolitionists, was threatened
with incendiary violence, notwithstanding it was the
shelter of an invalid wife, whose frail life often seemed
to hang on a thread. From that shaded and secluded
invalid chamber, however, came no weak prayers or
faltering purposes, for a braver, higher heart was never
given to human being than the one that beat there.
In the darkest and most dangerous hours, from that
sick room came words of hope and cheer and inspiration,
prompt ever to bid him go where the cause called
for him, and strengthening him by buoyant fearlessness
and high religious trust. Such women are a
true inspiration to men.</p>

<p>It is not wonderful that with such rare experience
of how noble a being woman may be, and with such
superior women for friends and associates, that Wendell
Phillips should have formed a high ideal of womanhood,
and become early one of the most enthusiastic
supporters of all reforms in which the interest of
woman is concerned.</p>

<p>On the 15th and 16th of October, 1857, he offered
at a convention held in Worcester a series of resolutions
in relation to the political rights of women which
cover all the ground contended for by modern reformers.
His speech on this subject is one of the most
able and eloquent on record, and forms a part of the
permanent literature of the movement.</p>

<p>He speaks of womanhood with a solemn and religious
earnestness, with the fervor of knightly times, and
pleads against all customs and laws which bear hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
upon her delicate organization, which mislead her from
following her highest aspirations.</p>

<p>An anecdote in circulation about him shows that he
not only held such theories, but that he was helpful in
practice. It is so in keeping with his general character
as to be extremely probable. Notwithstanding
the unpopularity of his abolition sentiments, Mr. Phillips'
power as an orator was such that when lecturing
on ordinary subjects he commanded the very highest
prices in the literary market. On one of his tours he
met in the cars a woman who was seeking a self-supporting
career as a lecturer. Mr. Phillips inquired into
her success, and found that independent of her expenses
she made at the rate only of five dollars a
time. He declared that such an inequality with his
own success was an injustice, and added that he must
beg her to allow him to equalize the account for once,
by accepting the proceeds of his last lecture.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips had a way of making his fame and reputation
gain him a hearing on the unpopular subject
which he had most at heart. Committees from anxious
lyceums used to wait on him for his terms, sure
of being able to fill a house by his name.</p>

<p>"What are your terms, Mr. Phillips?"</p>

<p>"If I lecture on anti-slavery, nothing. If on any
other subject one hundred dollars."</p>

<p>The success of his celebrated lecture on the Lost Arts,
which has been perhaps more than a thousand times
repeated, is only a chance specimen of what he might
have done in this department of lecturing, could he
have allowed himself that use of his talent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
Mr. Phillips is far from being a man of one idea.
Energetic as was his abolition campaign, he has found
time and strength to strike some of the heaviest and
most victorious blows for temperance. He has been
a vigorous defender of the interests of the Maine Law,
endangered in Massachusetts by the continual compliances
of rank and fashion. His letter to Judge Shaw
and President Walker is a specimen of unfearing and
unflinching exposure and rebuke of those practices
and concessions of public men, which cast contempt
on the execution of law. His oration on Metropolitan
Police has powerful arguments in favor of the policy
of legislative prevention of intemperance.</p>

<p>We have selected his argument on the subject, both
as a good example of his style and manner, and as a
powerful presentation of a much needed argument.</p>

<p>"Some men look upon this temperance cause as
whining bigotry, narrow asceticism, or a vulgar sentimentality,
fit for little minds, weak women, and weaker
men. On the contrary, I regard it as second only to
one or two others of the primary reforms of this age,
and for this reason. Every race has its peculiar temptation;
every clime has its specific sin. The tropics
and tropical races are tempted to one form of sensuality;
the colder and temperate regions, and our Saxon
blood, find their peculiar temptation in the stimulus
of drink and food. In old times our heaven was a
drunken revel. We relieve ourselves from the over-weariness
of constant and exhaustive toil by intoxication.
Science has brought a cheap means of drunkenness
within the reach of every individual. National
prosperity and free institutions have put into the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
of almost every workman the means of being drunk
for a week on the labor of two or three hours. With
that blood and that temptation, we have adopted democratic
institutions, where the law has no sanction but
the purpose and virtue of the masses. The statute-book
rests not on bayonets, as in Europe, but on the
hearts of the people. A drunken people can never be
the basis of a free government. It is the corner-stone
neither of virtue, prosperity, nor progress. To us,
therefore, the title-deeds of whose estates and the safety
of whose lives depend upon the tranquillity of the
streets, upon the virtue of the masses, the presence of
any vice which brutalizes the average mass of mankind,
and tends to make it more readily the tool of intriguing
and corrupt leaders, is necessarily a stab at the very
life of the nation. Against such a vice is marshalled
the Temperance Reformation. That my sketch is no
mere fancy picture, every one of you knows. Every
one of you can glance back over your own path, and
count many and many a one among those who started
from the goal at your side, with equal energy and perhaps
greater promise, who has found a drunkard's grave
long before this. The brightness of the bar, the ornament
of the pulpit, the hope and blessing and stay of
many a family,&mdash;you know, every one of you who has
reached middle life, how often on your path you set
up the warning, "Fallen before the temptations of the
streets!" Hardly one house in this city, whether it
be full and warm with all the luxury of wealth, or
whether it find hard, cold maintenance by the most
earnest economy, no matter which,&mdash;hardly a house
that does not count, among sons or nephews, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
victim of this vice. The skeleton of this warning sits
at every board. The whole world is kindred in this
suffering. The country mother launches her boy with
trembling upon the temptations of city life; the father
trusts his daughter anxiously to the young man she
has chosen, knowing what a wreck intoxication may
make of the house-tree they set up. Alas! how often
are their worst forebodings more than fulfilled! I
have known a case&mdash;and probably many of you can
recall some almost equal to it&mdash;where one worthy
woman could count father, brother, husband, and son-in-law,
all drunkards,&mdash;no man among her near kindred,
except her son, who was not a victim of this vice.
Like all other appetites, this finds resolution weak
when set against the constant presence of temptation.
This is the evil. How are the laws relating to it executed
in this city? Let me tell you.</p>

<p>"First, there has been great discussion of this evil,&mdash;wide,
earnest, patient discussion, for thirty-five years.
The whole community has been stirred by the discussion
of this question. Finally, after various experiments,
the majority of the State decided that the method
to stay this evil was to stop the open sale of intoxicating
drink. They left moral suasion still to address
the individual, and set themselves as a community to
close the doors of temptation. Every man acquainted
with his own nature or with society knows that weak
virtue, walking through our streets, and meeting at
every tenth door (for that is the average) the temptation
to drink, must fall; that one must be a moral
Hercules to stand erect. To prevent the open sale of
intoxicating liquor has been the method selected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
the State to help its citizens to be virtuous; in other
words, the State has enacted what is called the Maine
Liquor Law,&mdash;the plan of refusing all licenses to sell,
to be drunk on the spot or elsewhere, and allowing
only an official agent to sell for medicinal purposes and
the arts. You may drink in your own parlors, you
may make what indulgence you please your daily rule,
the State does not touch you there; there you injure
only yourself, and those you directly influence; that
the State cannot reach. But when you open your
door and say to your fellow-citizens, 'Come and indulge,'
the State has a right to ask, 'In what do you
invite them to indulge? Is it in something that helps,
or something that harms, the community?'"</p>

<p>In our recent war it is scarcely needful to say that
Mr. Phillips has always been a counsellor for the most
thorough, the most intrepid and most efficient measures.</p>

<p>During the period of comparative vacillation and
uncertainty, when McClellan was the commander-in-chief,
and war was being made on political principles,
Mr. Phillips did his utmost in speeches and public addresses
in the papers, to stir up the people to demand
a more efficient policy.</p>

<p>Since the termination of the war and the emancipation
of the slave, Mr. Phillips seems to show that
the class of gifts and faculties adapted to rouse a stupid
community, and to force attention to neglected
truths are not those most adapted to the delicate
work of reconstruction. The good knight who can cut
and hew in battle, cannot always do the surgeon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
work of healing and restoring. That exacting ideality
which is the leading faculty of Mr. Phillips' nature
leads him constantly to undervalue what has been
attained, and it is to be regretted that it deprived him
of the glow and triumph of a victory in which no man
than he better deserved to rejoice.</p>

<p>Garrison hung up his shield and sword at a definite
point, and marked the era of victory with devout thankfulness;
and we can but regret, that the more exacting
mind of Phillips was too much fixed on what yet
was wanting to share the well earned joy.</p>

<p>When there is strong light there must be shadow,
and the only shadow we discern in the public virtues
of Mr. Phillips is the want of a certain power to appreciate
and make allowances for the necessary weaknesses
and imperfections of human nature.</p>

<p>He has been a teacher of the school of the law rather
than that of the Gospel; he has been most especially
useful because we have been in a state where such
stern unflinching teachings have been indispensable.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips' methods indeed, of dealing with human
nature, savor wholly of the law and remind us forcibly
of the pithy and vigorous account which John Bunyan
puts into the mouth of his pilgrim.</p>

<p>"I saw one coming after me swift as the wind,
and so soon as the man overtook me, it was but a
word and a blow, for down he knocked me and laid
me for dead. But when I was a little come to myself
I asked him wherefore he served me so. He said because
of my secret inclining to Adam the first, and
with that he struck me another deadly blow on the
breast, and beat me down backward, and so I lay at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
his foot as dead as before. So when I came to myself,
I cried him mercy; but he said, I know not how
to show mercy, and with that he knocked me down
again. He had doubtless made an end of me but that
one came by and bid him forbear.</p>

<p>Who was he that bid him forbear? I did not know
him at first but as he went by, I perceived the holes
in his hands and his side."</p>

<p>There is a time for all things, and this stern work of
the land had to be done in our country. Almighty
God seconded it by awful providences, and pleaded
against the oppressor in the voice of famine and battle,
of fire and sword.</p>

<p>The guilty land had been riven and torn, and in the
language of scripture, made an astonishment and a
desolation!</p>

<p>May we not think now that the task of binding up
the wounds of a bruised and shattered country, of reconciling
jarring interests thrown into new and delicate
relationships, of bringing peace to sore and wearied
nerves, and abiding quiet to those who are fated
to dwell side by side in close proximity, may require
faculties of a wider and more varied adaptation, and
a spirit breathing more of Calvary and less of Sinai?</p>

<p>It is no discredit to the good sword gapped with the
blows of a hundred battle fields, to hang it up in all
honor, as having done its work.</p>

<p>It has made place for a thousand other forces and
influences each powerless without it, but each now
more powerful and more efficient in their own field.</p>

<p>Those who are so happy as to know Mr. Phillips
personally, are fully aware how entirely this unflinching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
austerity of judgment, this vigorous severity of exaction,
belong to his public character alone, how full
of genial urbanity they find the private individual.
We may be pardoned for expressing the hope that the
time may yet come when he shall see his way clear to
take counsel in public matters with his own kindly impulses,
and that those genial traits which render his private
intercourse so agreeable, may be allowed to modify at
least his public declarations.</p>

<p>Henry Ward Beecher was the eighth child of Lyman
and Roxana Foote Beecher, born in Litchfield,
Connecticut, June 24, 1813. The first child of a family
is generally an object of high hope and anxious and
careful attention. They are observed, watched&mdash;and
if the parents are so disposed, carefully educated, and
often over-watched and over-educated. But in large
families, as time rolls on and children multiply, especially
to those in straitened worldly circumstances, all
the interest of novelty dies out before the advent of
younger children, and they are apt to find their way
in early life unwatched and unheralded. Dr. Beecher's
salary was eight hundred dollars a year, not always
promptly paid. This made the problem of feeding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
clothing and educating a family of ten children a
dark one. The family was constantly enlarged by
boarders, young ladies attending the female academy,
and whose board helped somewhat to the support of
the domestic establishment, but added greatly to the
cares of the head manager. The younger members
of the Beecher family therefore came into existence
in a great bustling household of older people, all going
their separate ways, and having their own grown-up
interests to carry. The child, growing up in this
busy, active circle, had constantly impressed upon it
a sense of personal insignificance as a child, and the
absolute need of the virtue of passive obedience and
non-resistance as regards all grown-up people. To be
statedly washed and dressed and catechised, got to
school at regular hours in the morning, and to bed
inflexibly at the earliest possible hour at night, comprised
about all the attention that children could receive
in those days.</p>

<p>The mother of Henry Ward died when he was
three years old; his father was immersed in theological
investigations and a wide sphere of pastoral labors
and great general ecclesiastical interests, his grown-up
brothers and sisters in their own separate life history,
and the three younger children were therefore
left to their mortal pilgrimage, within certain well-defined
moral limits, much after their own way. The
step-mother, who took the station of mother, was a
lady of great personal elegance and attractiveness, of
high intellectual and moral culture, who from having
been in early life the much admired belle in general
society, came at last from an impulse of moral heroism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
combined with personal attachment, to undertake the
austere labors of a poor minister's family. She was a
person to make a deep impression on the minds of
any children. There was a moral force about her, a
dignity of demeanor, an air of elegance and superior
breeding, which produced a constant atmosphere of
unconscious awe in the minds of little ones. Then
her duties were onerous, her conscience inflexible, and
under the weight of these her stock of health and
animal spirits sunk, so that she was for the most part
pensive and depressed. Her nature and habits were
too refined and exacting for the bringing up of children
of great animal force and vigor, under the strain
and pressure of straitened circumstances. The absurdities
and crudenesses incident to the early days of such
children appeared to her as serious faults, and weighed
heavily on her conscience. The most intense positive
religious and moral influence the three little ones
of the family received was on Sunday night, when it
was her custom to take them to her bed-room and
read and talk and pray with them. At these times,
deep though vague religious yearnings were created;
but as she was much of her time an invalid, and had
little sympathy with the ordinary feelings of childhood,
she gave an impression of religion as being like
herself, calm, solemn, inflexible, mysteriously sad and
rigorously exacting.</p>

<p>In those days none of the attentions were paid
to children that are now usual. The community did
not recognize them. There was no child's literature;
there were no children's books. The Sunday school
was yet an experiment, in a fluctuating, uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
state of trial. There were no children's days of presents
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fêtes</i>&mdash;no Christmas or New Year's festivals.
The annual thanksgiving was only associated with one
day's unlimited range of pies of every sort&mdash;too much
for one day, and too soon things of the past. The
childhood of Henry Ward was unmarked by the possession
of a single child's toy as a gift from any older
person, or a single <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fête</i>. Very early, too, strict duties
devolved upon him; a daily portion of the work of
the establishment, the care of the domestic animals,
the cutting and piling of wood, or tasks in the garden
strengthened his muscles and gave vigor and tone to
his nerves. From his father and mother he inherited
a perfectly solid, healthy organization of brain, muscle
and nerves, and the uncaressing, let-alone system under
which he was brought up, gave him early habits
of vigor and self-reliance.</p>

<p>Litchfield was a mountain town, where the winter
was a stern reality for six months of the year, where
there were giant winds, and drifting snows of immeasurable
depth, and ice and sleet storms of a sublime
power and magnitude. Under this rugged nursing he
grew outwardly vigorous. At nine years of age, in
one of those winter droughts common in New England
towns, he harnessed the horse to a sledge with a barrel
lashed thereon, and went off alone three miles
over the icy top of the town hill, to dip up and bring
home a barrel of water from a distant spring. So far
from taking this as a hardship, he undertook it with a
chivalric pride. His only trial in the case was the humiliation
of being positively commanded by his careful
step-mother to wear his overcoat; he departed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
obedient, but with tears of mortification freezing on
his cheeks, for he had recorded a heroic vow to go
through a whole winter without once wearing an overcoat.</p>

<p>For education, technically so called, there were small
advantages. His earliest essay of letters was to walk
over to West street, to a widow Kilbourn's, where he sat
daily on a bench kicking his heels in idleness, and said
his letters twice in the day, and was for so long out of
the way of the grown folks, which was a main point
in child schooling. There was a tinner's shop hard
by, and the big girls, some of them, contrived to saw
off some of his long golden curls with tin shears contrived
from the fragments cast out of the shop. The
child was annoyed, but dared not complain to any
purpose, till the annoyance being stated at home, it
was concluded that the best way to abate it was to cut
off all the curls altogether, and with the loss of these
he considered his manhood to commence. Next, a
small, unpainted, district school-house being erected
within a stone's throw of the parsonage, he graduated
from Ma'am Kilbourn's thither. The children of all
the farming population in the neighborhood gathered
there. The exercises consisted in daily readings of
the Bible and the Columbian Orator, in elementary exercises
in arithmetic, and hand-writing. The ferule
and a long flexible hickory switch were the insignia
of office of the school mistress. No very striking
early results were the outcome of this teaching.
Henry Ward was not marked out by the prophecies
of partial friends for any brilliant future. He had precisely
the organization which often passes for dullness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
in early boyhood. He had great deficiency in verbal
memory, a deficiency marked in him through life;
he was excessively sensitive to praise and blame, extremely
diffident, and with a power of yearning, undeveloped
emotion, which he neither understood nor
could express. His utterance was thick and indistinct,
partly from bashfulness and partly from an enlargement
of the tonsils of the throat, so that in speaking
or reading he was with difficulty understood. In forecasting
his horoscope, had any one taken the trouble
then to do it, the last success that ever would have
been predicted for him would have been that of an
orator. "When Henry is sent to me with a message,"
said a good aunt, "I always have to make him say it
three times. The first time I have no manner of an
idea more than if he spoke Choctaw; the second, I
catch now and then a word; by the third time I begin
to understand."</p>

<p>Thus, while Dr. Beecher victoriously demonstrated
the consistency of decrees and accountability, and the
elder brother was drawing all the hopes of the family
as the first in his college class, and his elder sisters
were writing poetry and receiving visits, and carrying
on the cheerful round of Litchfield society, this bashful,
dazed-looking boy pattered barefoot to and from
the little unpainted school-house, with a brown towel
or a blue checked apron to hem during the intervals
between his spelling and reading lessons. Nobody
thought much of his future, further than to see that
he was safe and healthy, or even troubled themselves
to inquire what might be going on in his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
But the child most let alone, is nevertheless being
educated gradually and insensibly. The calm, inflexible,
elegant breeding of the step-mother, her intense
solemnity of religious responsibility, indicating itself
in every chance look or motion, fell on the sensitive
child-nature like a constant moral stimulant. When a
little fellow, whose small feet could not touch the bottom
of the old family chaise, he was once driving with
her on an errand. The bell tolled for a death, as was
then the custom in rural places. "Henry, what do
you think of when you hear a bell tolling like that?"
she said. Astonished and awe-struck at having his
thoughts inquired into, the child only flushed, and
colored and looked abashed, and she went on as in a
quiet soliloquy, "<i>I</i> think, was that soul prepared? It
has gone into <i>eternity</i>!" The effect on the child's
mind was a shiver of dread, like the being turned out
without clothing among the icy winds of Litchfield
hills. The vague sense of infinite, inevitable doom underlying
all the footsteps of life, added to a natural
disposition to yearning and melancholy. The scenery
around the parsonage fed the yearning&mdash;Chestnut Hill
on one side, with its lovely, softly wooded slopes, and
waving grain-fields; on the other, Mount Tom, with
steel-blue pines and a gleaming lake mirror at its
feet. Then there was the piano always going, and
the Scotch airs, Roslin Castle, Mary's Dream, and
Bonnie Doon, sounding out from the parlor windows,
and to which the boy listened in a sort of troublous
and dreamy mixture of sadness and joy, and walked
humming to himself with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
The greatest trial of those days was the catechism.
Sunday lessons were considered by the mother-in-law
as inflexible duty, and the catechism as the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine qua
non</i>. The other children memorized readily and were
brilliant reciters, but Henry, blushing, stammering,
confused and hopelessly miserable, stuck fast on some
sand-bank of what is required or forbidden by this or
that commandment, his mouth choking up with the
long words which he hopelessly miscalled; was sure to
be accused of idleness or inattention, and to be solemnly
talked to, which made him look more stolid and miserable
than ever, but appeared to have no effect in
quickening his dormant faculties.</p>

<p>When he was ten years old, he was a stocky, strong,
well-grown boy, loyal in duty, trained in unquestioning
obedience, inured to patient hard work, inured
also to the hearing and discussing of all the great theological
problems of Calvinism, which were always
reverberating in his hearing; but as to any mechanical
culture, in an extremely backward state&mdash;a poor
writer, a miserable speller, with a thick utterance, and
a bashful reticence which seemed like stolid stupidity.
He was now placed at a private school in the neighboring
town of Bethlehem, under the care of the Rev.
Mr. Langdon, to commence a somewhat more careful
course of study. Here an incident occurred which
showed that the boy even at that early age felt a mission
to defend opinions. A forward school-boy,
among the elder scholars, had got hold of Paine's Age
of Reason, and was flourishing largely among the boys
with objections to the Bible, drawn therefrom. Henry
privately looked up Watson's Apology, studied up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
subject, and challenged a debate with the big boy, in
which he came off victorious by the acclamation of
his school-fellows.</p>

<p>His progress in book-learning, however, was slow,
though his year at the place was one of great happiness.
One trait of the boy, as it has been with the
man, was a peculiar passion for natural scenery, which
he found full liberty to indulge in his present surroundings.
He boarded with a large-hearted, kindly,
motherly woman, in a great comfortable farm-house,
where everything was free and unconstrained. The
house was backed by a generous old orchard, full of
fruits and blossoms in spring and summer, and where
the partridges drummed and whirred in winter. Beyond
that were dreamy depths of woodland, and
Henry's studies were mostly with gun on shoulder,
roving the depths of those forests, guiltless of hitting
anything, because the time was lost in dreamy contemplation.
Thence returning unprepared for school,
he would be driven to the expedient of writing out
his Latin verb and surreptitiously reading it out of the
crown of his hat, an exercise from whence he reaped
small profit, either mentally or morally. In short,
after a year spent in this way, it began to be perceived
by the elders of the family, that as to the outward and
visible signs of learning, he was making no progress.
His eldest sister was then teaching a young lady's
school in Hartford, and it was proposed to take the
boy under her care to see what could be made of him.</p>

<p>One boy of eleven in a school of thirty or forty girls
has not much chance of making a durable impression,
but we question if any of Henry's school mates easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
forgot him. If the under stratum of his nature was a
dreamy yearning melancholy, its upper manifestation
was in constant bubbling, restless effervescence of fun
and practical joking. The school room was up a long
flight of stairs, and one wet day Henry spent a recess
when he was supposed to be studying grammar, in
opening every umbrella brought to school, and so disposing
them on the stairs that the luckless person who
opened the outside door would witness a precipitate
rush of the whole series into the street&mdash;which feat
was successfully accomplished to the dismay of the
late comer, and the tittering of the whole school, who
had been somewhat prepared for the catastrophe.</p>

<p>The school room was divided into two divisions in
grammar, under leaders on either side, and the grammatical
reviews were contests for superiority in which
it was vitally important that every member should be
perfected. Henry was generally the latest choice, and
fell on his side as an unlucky accession&mdash;being held
more amusing than profitable on such occasions.</p>

<p>The fair leader on one of these divisions took the
boy aside to a private apartment, to put into him with
female tact and insinuation those definitions and distinctions
on which the honor of the class depended.</p>

<p>"Now Henry, A is the indefinite article, you see&mdash;and
must be used only with a singular noun. You can
say <i>a man</i>&mdash;but you can't say <i>a men</i>, can you?" "Yes,
I can say <i>Amen</i> too," was the ready rejoinder. "Father
says it always at the end of his prayers."</p>

<p>"Come Henry, now don't be joking; now decline He."
"Nominative he, possessive his, objective him." "You
see, His is possessive. Now you can say, His book&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>but
you can't say 'Him book.'" "Yes I do say
Hymn book too," said the impracticable scholar with a
quizzical twinkle. Each one of these sallies made his
young teacher laugh, which was the victory he wanted.</p>

<p>"But now Henry, seriously, just attend to the active
and passive voice. Now 'I strike' is active, you see,
because if you strike you do something. But 'I am
struck,' is passive, because if you are struck you don't
do any thing do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes I do&mdash;I strike back again!"</p>

<p>Sometimes his views of philosophical subjects were
offered gratuitously. Being held rather of a frisky
nature, his sister appointed his seat at her elbow, when
she heard her classes. A class in Natural Philosophy,
not very well prepared, was stumbling through the
theory of the tides. "I can explain that," said Henry.
"Well, you see, the sun, he catches hold of the moon
and pulls her, and she catches hold of the sea and pulls
that, and this makes the spring tides.</p>

<p>"But what makes the neap tides?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's when the sun stops to spit on his hands,"
was the brisk rejoinder.</p>

<p>After about six months, Henry was returned on his
parents' hands with the reputation of being an inveterate
joker, and an indifferent scholar. It was the
opinion of his class that there was much talent lying
about loosely in him if he could only be brought to
apply himself.</p>

<p>When he was twelve years of age his father moved
to Boston. It was a great change to the two younger
boys, from the beautiful rural freedom of a picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
mountain town to the close, strait limits of a narrow
street in Boston.</p>

<p>There was a pure and vigorous atmosphere of moral
innocence about the mountain towns of Connecticut in
those days, which made the breeding up of children
on the let-alone system quite feasible. There was no
temptation to vice or immorality. The only associate
of doubtful character forbidden to Henry, for
whose society he craved, was Ulysses Freeman, a
poor, merry, softly giggling negro boy, who inhabited
a hut not far off, and who, it was feared, might
indiscreetly teach him something that he ought not
to know&mdash;but otherwise it was safe to let him run
unwatched, in the wholesome companionship of bob-o'links
and squirrels and birch woods and huckleberry
bushes. There was not in all Litchfield in those
days any thing to harm a growing boy, or lead him
into evil.</p>

<p>But in Boston, the streets, the wharves, the ship
yards, were full of temptation&mdash;the house, narrow and
strait. The boy was put into the Boston Latin School,
where the whole educational process was a solid square
attempt to smite the Latin grammar into minds of all
sorts and sizes, by a pressure like that by which coin
is stamped in the mint. Educated in loyal obedience
as a religion and a habit, pushed up to make the effort
by the entreaties of his father, by appeals to his gallantry
in overcoming difficulties, his sense of family
honor, and the solemn appeals to conscience of his
mother, Henry set himself doggedly to learn lists
of prepositions and terminations, and bead-rolls of nouns
that found their accusatives or genitives in this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
or that, except in the case of two dozen exceptions,
when they formed them in some other way, with all
the other dry prickly facts of language with which it
is deemed expedient to choke the efforts of beginners.</p>

<p>It was to him a grim Sinaitic desert, a land of darkness
without order, where he wandered, seeing neither
tree or flower; a wilderness of meaningless forms and
sounds. His life was a desolation, a blind push to do what
was most contrary to his natural faculties, repulsive to his
tastes, and in which with utmost stress and strain of effort
he could never hope to rise above mediocrity. One
year passed in this way, and with the fear of disgrace in
the rear and conscience and affection goading him on,
Henry had actually mastered the Latin grammar, and
could give any form or inflection, rule or exception
therein, but at an expense of brain and nerve that began
to tell even on his vigorous organization.</p>

<p>The era of fermentation and development was upon
him, and the melancholy that had brooded over his
childhood waxed more turbulent and formidable. He
grew gloomy and moody, restless and irritable. His
father, noticing the change, got him on a course of
biographical reading, hoping to divert his thoughts.
He began to read naval histories, the lives of great
sailors and commanders&mdash;the voyages of Captain Cook,
the biography of Nelson; and immediately, like lightning
flashing out of rolling clouds, came the determination
not to rest any longer in Boston, learning terminations
and prepositions, but to go forth to a life of
enterprise. He made up his little bundle, walked the
wharf and talked with sailors and captains, hovered
irresolute on the verge of voyages, never quite able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
to grieve his father by a sudden departure. At last
he wrote a letter announcing to a brother that he could
and would no longer remain at school&mdash;that he had
made up his mind for the sea; that if not permitted to
go, he should go without permission. This letter was
designedly dropped where his father picked it up.
Dr. Beecher put it in his pocket and said nothing for
the moment, but the next day asked Henry to help
him saw wood. Now the wood-pile was the Doctor's
favorite debating ground, and Henry felt complimented
by the invitation, as implying manly companionship.</p>

<p>"Let us see," says the Doctor, "Henry, how old are
you?"</p>

<p>"Almost fourteen!"</p>

<p>"Bless me! how boys do grow!&mdash;Why it's almost
time to be thinking what you are going to do. Have
you ever thought?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I want to go to sea."</p>

<p>"To sea! Of all things! Well, well! After all, why
not?&mdash;Of course you don't want to be a common sailor.
You want to get into the navy?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir, that's what I want."</p>

<p>"But not merely as a common sailor, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No sir, I want to be midshipman, and after that
commodore."</p>

<p>"I see," said the Doctor, cheerfully, "Well, Henry, in
order for that, you know, you must begin a course of
mathematics, and study navigation and all that."</p>

<p>"Yes sir, I am ready."</p>

<p>"Well then, I'll send you up to Amherst next week,
to Mount Pleasant, and then you'll begin your preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
studies, and if you are well prepared, I presume
I can make interest to get you an appointment."</p>

<p>And so he went to Mount Pleasant, in Amherst,
Mass., and Dr. Beecher said shrewdly, "I shall have
that boy in the ministry yet."</p>

<p>The transfer from the confined limits of a city to
the congenial atmosphere of a beautiful mountain town
brought an immediate favorable change. Here he
came under the care of a mathematical teacher, educated
at West Point, a bright attractive young man
of the name of Fitzgerald, with whom he roomed.
Between this young man and the boy, there arose a
romantic friendship. Henry had no natural talent or
taste for mathematics, but inspired by a desire to please
his friend, and high ambition for his future profession,
he went into them with energy, and soon did credit to
his teacher at the blackboard, laboring perseveringly
with his face towards the navy, and Nelson as his beau
ideal.</p>

<p>Here also he was put through a strict drill in elocution
by Professor John E. Lovell, now residing in New
Haven, Conn. Of him, Mr. Beecher cherishes a grateful
recollection, and never fails to send him a New
Year's token of remembrance. He says of him, that
"a better teacher in his department never was made."
Mr. Beecher had many natural disabilities for the line
of oratory; and their removal so far as to make him an
acceptable speaker he holds due to the persevering
drill of Mr. Lovell. His voice, naturally thick and
husky, was developed by most persevering, systematic
training. His gestures and the management of his body
went through a drill corresponding to that which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
military youth goes through at West Point, to make
his body supple to the exigencies of military evolution.
As an orator, this early training was of vital importance
to him. He could never have attained success
without it.</p>

<p>At the close of the first year, a revival of religion
passed through the school, and Henry Ward and
many others were powerfully impressed. It was in
fact, on the part of the boy, the mere flashing out into
visible form of that deep undercurrent of religious sensibility
which had been the habit of his life, and the
result of his whole home education. His father sent
for him home to unite with the church on a great communion
season; and the boy, trembling, agitated, awe-struck,
full of vague purposes and good resolutions
and imperfectly developed ideas, stood up and took
on him irrevocable vows, henceforth in his future life
to be actively and openly on the side of Christ, in the
great life battle.</p>

<p>Of course the naval scheme vanished, and the pulpit
opened before him as his natural sphere. With
any other father or education, this would not have been
an "of course;" but Dr. Beecher was an enthusiast in
his profession. Every word of his life, every action
or mode of speaking, had held it up before his boys as
the goal of all his hopes, that they should preach the
gospel, and the boy therefore felt that to be the necessary
obligation which came upon him in joining the
church. He returned to Amherst, where his classical
education was continued for two years longer, with a
view to fit him for college.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
The love of flowers, which has always formed so
marked a branch of his general enthusiasm for nature,
developed itself at this time in a friendship with a
rather rough man who kept a garden. He was so
pleased with the boy's enthusiasm that he set apart a
scrap of ground for him which he filled with roses,
geraniums and other blooming wonders, and these
Henry tended under his instructions.</p>

<p>At that time the love of nature was little cultivated
among the community. By very many good people,
nature was little spoken of except as the antithesis
to grace. It was the tempter, the syren that drew the
soul from higher duties. The chaplain of Mount Pleasant
Institute, a grave and formal divine, found Henry
on his knees in his little flower patch, lost in rapturous
contemplations of buds and blossoms. He gave
him an indulgent smile, but felt it his duty to improve
the occasion.</p>

<p>"Ah, Henry," he said condescendingly, as one who
makes a fair admission, "these things are pretty, very
pretty, but my boy, do you think that such things are
worthy to occupy the attention of a man who has an
immortal soul?" Henry answered only by that abashed
and stolid look which covered from the eyes of his
superiors, so much of what was going on within him,
and went on with attentions to his flowers. "I wanted
to tell him," he said afterwards, "that since Almighty
God has found leisure to make those trifles, it could
not be amiss for us to find time to look at them." By
the time that Henry had been three years in Amherst
he was prepared to enter Sophomore in College.
Thanks to his friend and teacher Fitzgerald, his mathematical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
training had given him the entire mastery of
La Croix's Algebra, so that he was prepared to demonstrate
at random any proposition as chance selected&mdash;not
only without aid or prompting from the teacher,
but controversially as against the teacher, who would
sometimes publicly attack the pupil's method of demonstration,
disputing him step by step, when the
scholar was expected to know with such positive clearness
as to put down and overthrow the teacher. "You
must not only know, but you must know that you
know," was Fitzgerald's maxim; and Henry Ward
attributes much of his subsequent habit of steady antagonistic
defence of his own opinions to this early
mathematical training.</p>

<p>Though prepared for the Sophomore class, his father
however, deemed it best on the whole, that he
should enter as freshman, and the advanced state of
his preparation therefore gave him leisure the first
year to mark out and commence a course of self-education
by means of the college libraries, which he
afterwards systematically pursued through college life.
In fact he gave no more attention to the college course
than was absolutely essential to keep his standing, but
turned all the power of study and concentrated attention
he had acquired in his previous years, upon his
own plan of culture. As he himself remarks, "I had
acquired by the Latin and mathematics, the power of
study. I knew how to study, and I turned it upon
things I wanted to know." The Latin and Greek classics
did not attract him. The want of social warmth
in the remove at which they stood from the living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
present, alienated them from the sympathies of one
who felt his mission to be among the men of to-day,
and by its living literature. Oratory and rhetoric he
regarded as his appointed weapons, and he began to
prepare himself in the department of how to say&mdash;meanwhile
contemplating with uncertain awe, the great
future problem of <span class="smcap smaller">WHAT TO SAY</span>.</p>

<p>For the formation of style he began a course of
English classical study; Milton's prose works, Bacon,
Shakspeare, and the writers of the Elizabethan period
were his classics, read and re-read, and deeply pondered.
In common with most of the young men of
his period, he was a warm admirer of the writings of
Robert Hall, and added him to his list of favorite authors.
His habits of study were somewhat peculiar.
He had made for himself at the carpenter's, a circular
table, with a hole in the middle, where was fixed a
seat. Enthroned in this seat with his English classics
all around him, he read and pondered, and with never
ceasing delight.</p>

<p>The stand he took in college, was from the first that
of a reformer. He was always on the side of law and
order, and being one of the most popular fellows in his
class, threw the whole weight of his popularity in favor
of the faculty, rather than against them. He and his associates
formed a union of merry good fellows, who
were to have glorious fun, but to have it only by honorable
and permissible means. They voted down scraping
in the lecture rooms, and hazing of students; they voted
down gambling and drinking, and every form of secret
vice, and made the class rigidly temperate and pure.
Mr. Beecher had received from family descent what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
might be called a strictly temperance organization. In no
part of his life did he ever use, or was he ever tempted
to use tobacco or ardent spirits in any shape. All
his public labors, like those of his father before him,
have been performed by the strict legal income of ordinary
nervous investment; they have not been those
deep ruinous drafts on the reserved principal of vital
force, which are drawn by the excitements of extra
stimulants.</p>

<p>He also maintained the character of a Christian student,
by conscientious attention to the class prayer
meetings, in which he took his part, as well as by outside
religious and temperance labors in the rural population
in the neighborhood. He very early formed
an attachment to a beneficiary in the college, a man, as
he says, of the Isaiah type, large-souled, and full of
devotion, who took the boy round with him on his
tour of religious exhortation, insisting with paternal
earnestness that it was his immediate duty to begin to
practice for the work of the Christian ministry. Having
brought him once or twice to read and pray, in a
little rural meeting, held in a school-house in the outskirts
of the village, he solemnly committed the future
care of the meeting to the young disciple, and went
himself to look up another fold. This meeting Henry
religiously kept up among his others, with varying
success, during his college career.</p>

<p>The only thing which prevented him from taking the
first rank as a religious young man, was the want of
that sobriety and solemnity which was looked upon as
essential to the Christian character. Mr. Beecher was
like a converted bob-o'link, who should be brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
judgment for short quirks and undignified twitters
and tweedles, among the daisy heads, instead of flying
in dignified paternal sweeps, like a good swallow
of the sanctuary, or sitting in solemnized meditation
in the depths of pine trees like the owl.</p>

<p>His commendation from the stricter brethren generally
came with the sort of qualification which Shakspeare
<span class="locked">makes,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"For the man doth fear God, howbeit it doth not
always appear, by reason of some large jests which he
will make."</p>

<p>In fact, Mr. Beecher was generally the center of a
circle of tempestuous merriment, ever eddying round
him in one droll form or another. He was quick in
repartee, an excellent mimic, and his stories would
set the gravest in a roar. He had the art, when admonished
by graver people, of somehow entrapping
them into more uproarious laughing than he himself
practiced, and then looking innocently surprised. Mr.
Beecher on one occasion was informed that the head
tutor of the class was about to make him a grave exhortatory
visit. The tutor was almost seven feet high,
and solemn as an Alpine forest, but Mr. Beecher knew
that like most solemn Yankees, he was at heart a deplorable
wag, a mere whited sepulchre of conscientious
gravity, with measureless depths of unrenewed chuckle
hid away in the depths of his heart. When apprised
of his approach, he suddenly whisked into the wood-closet
the chairs of his room, leaving only a low one
which had been sawed off at the second joint, so that
it stood about a foot from the floor. Then he crawled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
through the hole in his table, and seated meekly
among his books, awaited the visit.</p>

<p>A grave rap, is heard:&mdash;"Come in."</p>

<p>Far up in the air, the solemn dark face appears.
Mr. Beecher rose ingenuously, and offered to come out.
"No, never mind," says the visitor, "I just came to
have a little conversation with you. Don't move."</p>

<p>"Oh," says Beecher innocently, "pray sit down
sir," indicating the only chair.</p>

<p>The tutor looked apprehensively, but began the
process of sitting down. He went down, down, down,
but still no solid ground being gained, straightened
himself and looked uneasy.</p>

<p>"I don't know but that chair is too low for you,"
said Beecher meekly; "do let me get you another."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, my young friend, don't rise, don't trouble
yourself, it is perfectly agreeable to me, in fact I
like a low seat," and with these words, the tall man
doubled up like a jack-knife, and was seen sitting with
his grave face between his knees, like a grass-hopper
drawn up for a spring. He heaved a deep sigh, and
his eyes met the eyes of Mr. Beecher; the hidden spark
of native depravity within him was exploded by one
glance at those merry eyes, and he burst into a loud roar
of merriment, which the two continued for some time,
greatly to the amusement of the boys, who were watching
to hear how Beecher would come out with his lecture.
The chair was known in college afterwards, by
the surname of the "Tutor's Delight." This overflow
of the faculty of mirthfulness, has all his life deceived
those who had only a shallow acquaintance with him,
and men ignorant of the depth of yearning earnestness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
and profound strength of purpose on which they
rippled and sparkled.</p>

<p>But at the time that he passed for the first humorist
of college, the marks along his well worn volumes of
the old English poets show only appreciation of
what is earnest, deep and pathetic. He particularly
loved an obscure old poet of whom we scarcely hear
in modern days, Daniel, who succeeded Edmund Spenser
as poet laureate, and was a friend of Shakspeare.</p>

<p>Some lines addressed by him to the Earl of Southampton,
are marked by reiterated lines in Mr. Beecher's
copy of the old English poets, which showed enthusiastic
reading. He says, "This was about the only
piece of poetry I ever committed to memory, but I
read it so much I could not help at last knowing it by
heart:"</p>

<p class="p2 center">"TO THE EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON.</p>

<p>Such an enthusiasm shows clearly on what a key

<p>These verses are so marked with Mr. Beecher's life
habits of thought, with his modes of expression, that
they show strongly the influence which these old poets
had in forming both his habits of thought and expression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
His mind naturally aspired after heroism, and
from the time that he gave up his youthful naval enthusiasm
he turned the direction of the heroic faculties
into moral things.</p>

<p>In the course of the sophomore year, Mr. Beecher
was led, as a mere jovial frolic, to begin a course of
investigation which colored his whole after life. A
tall, grave, sober fellow had been reading some articles
on Phrenology, on which Spurzheim was then
lecturing in Boston, and avowed himself a convert.
Quick as thought, the wits of college saw in this an
occasion for glorious fun. They proposed to him with
great apparent earnestness that he should deliver a
course of lectures on the subject in Beecher's room.</p>

<p>With all simplicity and solemnity he complied,
while the ingenuous young inquirers began busily arming
themselves with objections to and puzzles for him,
by reading the scoffing articles in Blackwood and the
Edinburgh. The fun waxed hearty, and many saw
nothing in it but a new pasture ground to be ploughed
and seeded down for an endless harvest of college
jokes. But one day, one of the clearest headed and
most powerful thinkers in the class said to Beecher,
"What is your estimate of the real logical validity
of these objections to Phrenology?" "Why," said
Beecher, "I was thinking that if these objections were
all that could be alleged, I could knock them to pieces."
"So I think," said the other. In fact, the inanity
of the crusade against the theory brought forth
converts faster than its direct defence. Mr. Beecher
and his associates formed immediately a club for physiological
research. He himself commenced reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
right and left, in all the works of anatomy and physiology
which he could lay hands on, either in the
college or village libraries. He sent and bought for
his own private use, Magendie's Physiology, Combe's
Phrenology, and the works of Gall and Spurzheim.
A phrenological union was formed to purchase together
charts, models and dissecting tools, for the study of
comparative anatomy. It was even planned, in the
enthusiasm of young discipleship, to establish a private
dissecting room for the club, but the difficulties
attending the procuring of proper subjects prevented
its being carried into effect. By correspondence with
his brother Charles, however, who was then in Bowdoin
College, an affiliated phrenological club was
formed in that institution, and his letters of this period
were all on and about phrenological subjects, and in
full phrenological dialect. Mr. Beecher delivered
three lectures on the subject in the village lyceum,
and did an infinity of private writing and study.</p>

<p>He read the old English dramatists, particularly
Ben Jonson, Massinger, Webster, Ford and Shakspeare,
and wrote out analyses of their principal characters on
phrenological principles. The college text-book of
mental philosophy was Browne, and Mr. Beecher's
copy of Browne is marked through and through, and
interlined with comparative statements of the ideas
derived from his physiological investigation. With
these also he carefully read and analyzed Locke, Stuart,
Reid, and the other writers of the Scotch school.
As a writer and debater, Mr. Beecher was acknowledged
the first of the class, and was made first president
of the Athenian Society, notwithstanding it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
been a time-honored precedent that that distinction
should belong only to the presumptive valedictorian.
The classics and mathematics he had abandoned because
of his interest in other things, but that abandonment
settled the fact that he could never aspire to
high college honors. He however, wrote for one of
his papers in a college newspaper a vigorous defence
of mathematical studies, which won the approbation
and surprise of his teachers. It was a compliment
paid by rhetoric to her silent sister.</p>

<p>The phrenological and physiological course thus
begun in college was pursued by few of the phrenological
club in after life. With many it died out as a
boyish enthusiasm; with one or two, as Messrs. Fowler
of New York, it became a continuous source of interest
and profit. With Mr. Beecher it led to a broad
course of physiological study and enquiry, which, collated
with metaphysics and theology, has formed his
system of thought through life. From that day he
has continued the reading and study of all the physiological
writers in the English language. In fact, he
may be said during his college life to have constructed
for himself a physiological mental philosophy out of
the writings of the Scotch metaphysical school and
that of Combe, Spurzheim, and the other physiologists.
Mr. Beecher is far from looking on phrenology as a
perfected science. He regards it in relation to real
truth as an artist's study towards a completed landscape;
a study on right principles and in a right direction,
but not as a completed work. In his view,
the phrenologists, physiologists and mental philosophers
of past days have all been partialists, giving a limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>
view of the great subject. The true mental philosophy,
as he thinks, is yet to arise from a consideration
of all the facts and principles evolved by all of them.</p>

<p>Thus much is due for the understanding of Mr.
Beecher's style, in which to a great extent he uses the
phrenological terminology, a terminology so neat and
descriptive, and definite in respect to human beings as
they really exist, that it gives a great advantage to
any speaker. The terms of phrenology have in fact
become accepted as conveniences in treating of human
nature, as much as the algebraic signs in numbers.</p>

<p>The depth of Mr. Beecher's religious nature prevented
this enthusiasm for material science from degenerating
into dry materialism. He was a Calvinist in
the earnestness of his intense need of the highest and
deepest in religion. In his sophomore year there was
a revival of religion in college, in which his mind
was powerfully excited. He reviewed the almost
childish experiences under which he had joined the
church, as possibly deceptive, and tried and disciplined
himself by those profound tests with which the Edwardean
theology had filled the minds of New England.
A blank despair was the result. He applied to
Dr. Humphrey, who simply told him that his present
feelings were a work of the spirit, and with which he
dared not interfere. After days of almost hopeless
prayer, there came suddenly into his mind an ineffable
and overpowering perception of the Divine love,
which seemed to him like a revelation. It dispelled
all doubts, all fears; he became buoyant and triumphant,
and that buoyancy has been marked in his religious
teachings ever since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
Mr. Beecher's doctrine upon the subject is that the
truths of the Divine nature are undiscoverable by the
mere logical faculties, that they are the province of a
still higher class of faculties which belong to human
nature, the faculties of <i>spiritual intuition</i>; that it is
through these <i>spiritual intuitions</i> that the Holy Spirit
of God communes with man, and directs through them
the movements of the lower faculties. In full faith in
the dependence of man on the Holy Spirit for these
spiritual intuitions, he holds substantially the same
ground with Jonathan Edwards, though he believes
that Divine influence to be far more widely, constantly
and fully given to the children of men than did
that old divine.</p>

<p>During his two last college years, Mr. Beecher, like
other members of his class, taught rural schools during
the long winter vacations. In this way he raised funds
of his own to buy that peculiar library which his tastes
and studies caused him to accumulate about him. In
both these places he performed the work of a religious
teacher, preaching and exhorting regularly in stated
meetings, giving temperance lectures, or doing any
reformatory work that came to hand. In the controversy
then arising through the land in relation to slavery,
Mr. Beecher from the first took the ground and
was willing to bear the name of an abolitionist. It
was a part of the heroic element of his nature always
to stand for the weak, and he naturally inclined to
take that stand in a battle where the few were at odds
against the many.</p>

<p>In 1832 Dr. Lyman Beecher moved to Cincinnati,
two years before the completion of Henry's college
course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
He graduated in 1834, and went out to Cincinnati.
The abolition excitement at Lane Seminary had just
ended, by the departure of a whole class of some thirty
students, with Theodore Weld at their head.</p>

<p>Dr. Beecher was now the central point of a great
theological battle. It was a sort of spiritual Armageddon,
being the confluence of the forces of the Scotch-Irish
Presbyterian Calvinistic fatalism, meeting in
battle with the advancing rationalism of New England
new school theology. On one side was hard literal
interpretation of Bible declarations and the Presbyterian
standards, asserting man's utter and absolute
natural and moral inability to obey God's commands,
and on the other side, the doctrine of man's free agency,
and bringing to the rendering of the declarations
of the scriptures and of the standards, the lights of
modern modes of interpretation.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson, who headed the attacking party, was a
man in many points marvellously resembling General
Jackson, both in person and character, and he fought
the battle with the same gallant, headlong vigor and
sincere unflinching constancy. His habits of thought
were those of a western pioneer, accustomed from childhood
to battle with Indians and wild beasts, in the
frontier life of an early state. His views of mental
philosophy, and of the modes of influencing the human
mind, were like those of the Emperor Constantine
when he commanded a whole synod of bishops to
think alike without a day's delay, or those of the Duke
of Wellington, when he told the doubting inquirers at
Oxford, that "the thing to be done was to sign the
thirty-nine articles, and believe them." The party he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
headed, were vigorous, powerful and with all that immense
advantage which positive certainty and a literal,
positively expressed belief always gives. With
such an army and such a general, the fight of course
was a warm one, and Dr. Beecher's sons found themselves
at once his armor bearers in the thickest of the
battle. The great number of ascending judicatories
in the Presbyterian Church gave infinite scope for protracting
a contest where every point of doctrine could
first be discussed and voted on in Presbytery, then adjourned
to Synod, then carried to General Assembly,
and in each had to be discussed and decided by majorities.
What scope for activity in those times! What racing
and chasing along muddy western roads, to obscure
towns, each party hoping that the length of the way
and the depth of the mud would discourage their
opponents, keep them away and so give their own
side the majority. Dr. Beecher and his sons, it was
soon found could race and chase and ride like born
Kentuckians, and that "free agency" on horse-back,
would go through mud and fire, and water, as gallantly
as ever "natural inability" could. There was
something grimly ludicrous in the dismay with which
Dr. Wilson, inured from his boyhood to bear-fights, and
to days and nights spent in cane-brakes, and dens of
wolves, found on his stopping at an obscure log hut in
the depth of the wilderness, Dr. Beecher with his sons
and his new school delegates, ahead of him, on their
way to Synod.</p>

<p>The study of theology at Lane Seminary, under these
circumstances, was very largely from the controversial
and dialectic point of view. It was, to a great extent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
the science of defence of new school as against old
school.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher was enthusiastically devoted to his father,
and of course felt interested in his success as a personal
matter, but in regard to the whole wide controversy,
his interest was more that of a spectator than
of a partizan on either side. He had already begun
his study of mental and moral philosophy on a broad
eclectic basis, taking great account of facts and phenomena
which he saw to be wholly ignored by the
combatants on both sides. The mental philosophy of
Reid and the Scotch school, on which Dr. Beecher
based his definitions, he regarded as only partially true,
and had set down in his own mind at a definite value.
The intense zeal and perfect undoubting faith with
which both sides fought their battle, impressed him as
only a strange and interesting and curious study in his
favorite science of anthropology.</p>

<p>He gave his attention to the system, understood it
thoroughly, was master of all its modes of attack,
fence and defence, but he did it much as a person now-a
days might put on a suit of mediæval armor, and
study mediæval tactics.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher had inherited from his father what has
been called a genius for friendship. He was never
without the anchor of an enthusiastic personal attachment
for somebody, and at Lane Seminary, he formed
such an intimacy with Professor C.&nbsp;E. Stowe, whose
room-mate for some length of time he was, and in
whose society he took great delight. Professor Stowe,
a man devoted to scholarly learning and Biblical criticism,
was equally with young Beecher standing as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
spectator in the great theological contest which was
raging around him, and which he surveyed from still
another stand-point, of ecclesiastical history and biblical
criticism. It was some considerable inconvenience
to the scholarly professor, to be pulled up from his
darling books, and his interjections were not always
strictly edifying when he was raced through muddy
lanes, and rattled over corduroy roads, under the vigorous
generalship of Dr. Beecher, all that he might
give his vote for or against some point of doctrine,
which, in his opinion, common sense had decided ages
ago. He was also, somewhat of a strict disciplinarian
and disposed to be severe on the discursive habits of
his young friend, who was quite too apt to neglect or
transcend conventional rule. The morning prayers at
Lane were at conventual hours, and Henry's devotional
propensities, of a dark cold winter morning, were almost
impossible to be aroused, while his friend, who
was punctuality itself, was always up and away in the
gloaming. One morning, when the Professor had indignantly
rebuked the lazy young Christian, whom he
left tucked in bed, and, shaking the dust from his
feet, had departed to his morning duties, Henry took
advantage of his own habits of alert motion, sprang
from the bed, dressed himself in a twinkling, and taking
a cross-lot passage, was found decorously sitting
directly under the Professor's desk, waiting for him,
when he entered to conduct prayers. The stare of
almost frightened amazement with which the Professor
met him, was the ample reward of his exertions.</p>

<p>Though Professor Stowe never succeeded in making
him an exact linguist, or shaping him into a biblical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
scholar, yet he was of great service to him in starting
his mind in a right general direction in the study
of the Bible. The old and the new school were both
too much agreed in using the Bible as a carpenter does
his nail-box, going to it only to find screws and nails
to hold together the framework of a theological
system. Professor Stowe inspired him with the idea
of surveying the books of the Bible as divinely inspired
compositions, yet truly and warmly human,
and to be rendered and interpreted by the same rules
of reason and common sense which pertain to all human
documents.</p>

<p>As the time drew near in which Mr. Beecher was
to assume the work of the ministry, he was oppressed
by a deep melancholy. He had the most exalted
ideas of what ought to be done by a Christian minister.
He had transferred to that profession all those ideals of
courage, enterprise, zeal and knightly daring which
were the dreams of his boyhood, and which he first
hoped to realize in the naval profession. He felt that
the holy calling stood high above all others, that to
enter it from any unholy motive, or to enter and
not do a worthy work in it, was a treason to all honor.</p>

<p>His view of the great object of the ministry was
sincerely and heartily the same with that of his father;
to secure the regeneration of the individual heart by
the Divine spirit, and thereby to effect the regeneration
of human society. The problem that oppressed
him was, how to do this. His father had used certain
moral and intellectual weapons, and used them strongly
and effectively, because employing them with undoubting
faith. So many other considerations had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
come into his mind to qualify and limit that faith, so
many new modes of thought and inquiry, that were
partially inconsistent with the received statements of
his party, that he felt he could never grasp and wield
them with the force which would make them efficient.
It was no comfort to him that he could wield the weapons
of his theological party, so as to dazzle and confound
objectors, while all the time conscious in his own
soul of objections more profound and perplexities more
bewildering. Like the shepherd boy of old, he saw
the giant of sin stalking through the world, defying
the armies of the living God, and longed to attack him,
but the armor in which he had been equipped for the
battle was no help, but only an incumbrance!</p>

<p>His brother, who studied with him, had already become
an unbeliever, and thrown up the design of
preaching, and he could not bear to think of adding
to his father's trials by deserting the standard. Yet
his distress and perplexity were so great that at times
he seriously contemplated going into some other profession.</p>

<p>What to say to make men Christians,&mdash;how to raise
man to God really and truly,&mdash;was to him an awful
question. Nothing short of success in this appeared
to him success in the Christian ministry.</p>

<p>Pending these mental conflicts, he performed some
public labors. He was for four or five months editor
of the Cincinnati Journal, the organ of the N.&nbsp;S. Presbyterian
Church, during the absence of Mr. Brainard.
While he was holding this post, the pro-slavery riot
which destroyed Birney's press occurred, and the editorials
of the young editor at this time were copied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
with high approval by Charles Hammond, of the Cincinnati
Gazette, undoubtedly the ablest editor of the
West, and the only other editor who dared to utter a
word condemnatory of the action of the rioters. Mr.
Beecher entered on the defence of the persecuted negroes
with all the enthusiasm of his nature. He had
always a latent martial enthusiasm, and though his
whole life had been a peaceful one, yet a facility in
the use of carnal weapons seemed a second nature,
and at this time, he, with a number of other young
men went to the mayor and were sworn in as a special
body of police, who patroled the streets, well armed.
Mr. Beecher wore his pistol, and was determined, should
occasion arise, to use it. But as usual in such cases, a
resolute front once shown dissolved the mob entirely.</p>

<p>In his last theological term he took a Bible class in
the city of Cincinnati, and began studying and teaching
the evangelists. With the course of this study
and teaching came a period of spiritual clairvoyance.
His mental perplexities were relieved, and the great
question of "what to preach," was solved. The shepherd
boy laid aside his cumbrous armor, and found
in a clear brook a simple stone that smote down the
giant, and so from the clear waters of the gospel narrative,
Mr. Beecher drew forth that "white stone with
a new name," which was to be the talisman of his
ministry. To present Jesus Christ, personally, as the
Friend and Helper of Humanity, Christ as God impersonate,
eternally and by a necessity of his nature
helpful and remedial and restorative; the friend of
each individual soul, and thus the friend of all society;
this was the one thing which his soul rested on as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span>
worthy object in entering the ministry. He afterward
said, in speaking of his feelings at this time: "I was
like the man in the story to whom a fairy gave a
purse with a single piece of money in it, which he
found always came again as soon as he had spent it.
I thought I knew at last one thing to preach, I found
it included everything."</p>

<p>Immediately on finishing his theological course, Mr.
Beecher married and was settled in Lawrenceburg.
He made short work of the question of settlement,
accepting the very first offer that was made him. It
was work that he wanted, and one place he thought
about as good as another. His parish was a little town
on the Ohio river, not far from Cincinnati. Here he
preached in a small church, and did all the work of
the parish sexton, making his fires, trimming his lamps,
sweeping his house, and ringing his bell. "I did all,"
he said whimsically, "but come to hear myself preach&mdash;that
they had to do." The little western villages
of those days had none of the attractions of New
England rural life. They were more like the back
suburbs of a great city, a street of houses without
yards or gardens, run up for the most part in a cheap
and flimsy manner, and the whole air of society marked
with the impress of a population who have no local
attachments, and are making a mere temporary sojourn
for money-getting purposes. Mr. Beecher was soon
invited from Lawrenceburg to Indianapolis, the capital
of the State, where he labored for eight years.</p>

<p>His life here was of an Arcadian simplicity. He
inhabited a cottage on the outskirts of the town, where
he cultivated a garden, and gathered around him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
horse, cow and pig; all that wholesome suite of domestic
animals which he had been accustomed to care
for in early life. He was an enthusiast on all these
matters, fastidious about breeds and blood, and each
domestic animal was a pet and received his own personal
attentions. In the note-books of this period,
amid hints for sermons, come memoranda respecting
his favorite Berkshire pig, or Durham cow. He read
on gardening, farming, and stock-raising, all that he
could lay hands on; he imported from eastern cultivators
all sorts of roses and all sorts of pear trees and
grape vines, and edited a horticultural paper, which
had quite a circulation.</p>

<p>All this was mainly the amusement of his leisure
hours, as he preached always twice on Sunday, and
held at an average five other meetings a week in different
districts of the city. For three months of every
year, by consent of his people, he devoted himself to
missionary duty through the State, riding from point
to point on horseback, and preaching every day of
the week.</p>

<p>In his theological studies he had but just two volumes&mdash;the
Bible and human nature, which he held to
be indispensable to the understanding each of the
other. He said to himself, "The Apostles who first
preached Christ, made converts who were willing to
dare or do anything for him. How did they do this?"
He studied all the recorded discourses of the Apostles
in the book of Acts, in his analytical method, asking,
to what principles of human nature did they appeal?
What were their methods of statement? He endeavored
to compose sermons on similar principles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
test them by their effects on men. He noticed that
the Apostles always based their appeals to men on
some common truth, admitted by both parties alike;
that they struck at the great facts of moral consciousness,
and he imitated them in this. He was an intense
observer and student of men as they are. His large
social talent, his predominating play of humor and
drollery, were the shields under which he was constantly
carrying on his inquiries into what man is, and
how he can be reached. Seated in the places where
men congregate to loaf and talk, he read his newspaper
with his eyes and ears open to more than its pages.
His preaching began to draw listeners as a new style
of thing. Its studies into human nature, its searching
analysis of men and their ways, drew constant listeners.
His fame spread through the country, and multitudes,
wherever he went, flocked to hear him. Still,
Mr. Beecher did not satisfy himself. To be a popular
preacher, to be well spoken of, to fill up his church,
did not after all satisfy his ideal. It was necessary
that the signs of an Apostle should be wrought in him
by his having the power given to work the great, deep
and permanent change which unites the soul to God.
It was not till about the third year of his ministry that
he found this satisfaction in a great revival of religion
in Terre Haute, which was followed by a series of
such revivals through the State, in which he was for
many months unceasingly active. When he began to
see whole communities moving together under a
spiritual impulse, the grog-shops abandoned, the
votaries of drunkenness, gambling and dissipation reclaimed,
reformed, and sitting at the feet of Jesus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
clothed and in their right mind, he felt that at last he
had attained what his soul thirsted for, and that he
could enter into the joy of the Apostles when they
returned to Jesus, saying, "Lord, by thy name even
the devils were made subject unto us."</p>

<p>His preaching of Christ at this time was spoken of
as something very striking in its ceaseless iteration of
one theme, made constantly new and various by new
applications to human want and sin and sorrow.</p>

<p>A member of his church in Indianapolis, recently,
in writing the history of the church with which he
was connected, thus gives his recollections of him:</p>

<p>"In the early spring of 1842, a revival began, more
noticeable, perhaps, than any that this church or this
community has seen. The whole town was pervaded
by the influences of religion. For many weeks the
work continued with unabated power, and at three
communion seasons, held successively in February,
March and April, 1842, nearly one hundred persons
were added to the church on profession of their faith.
This was God's work. It is not improper, however,
to speak of the pastor in that revival, as he is remembered
by some of the congregation, plunging through
the wet streets, his trousers stuffed in his muddy bootlegs,
earnest, untiring, swift; with a merry heart, a
glowing face, and a helpful word for every one; the
whole day preaching Christ to the people where he
could find them, and at night preaching still where
the people were sure to find him. It is true that in
this revival some wood and hay and stubble were
gathered with the gold and silver and precious stones.
As in all new communities, there was special danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
of unhealthy excitement. But in general the results
were most happy for the church and for the town.
Some of those who have been pillars since, found the
Saviour in that memorable time. Nor was the awakening
succeeded by an immediate relapse.</p>

<p>"Early in the following year, at the March and
April communions, the church had large accessions,
and it had also in 1845. There was, indeed, a wholesome
and nearly continuous growth up to the time
when the first pastor resigned, to accept a call to the
Plymouth Congregational church, in Brooklyn, New
York. This occurred August 24th, 1847, and on the
nineteenth of the following month Mr. Beecher's labors
for the congregation ceased.</p>

<p>"The pastorate, thus terminated, had extended
through more than eight years. During this time
much had been accomplished. The society had built
a pleasant house of worship. The membership had
advanced from thirty-two to two hundred and seventy-five.
What was considered a doubtful enterprise,
inaugurated as it had been amidst many prophecies of
failure, had risen to an enviable position, not only in
the capital but in the State. The attachment between
pastor and people had become peculiarly strong.
Mutual toils and sufferings and successes had bound
them fast together. Only the demands of a wider
field, making duty plain, divided them, and a recent
letter proves that the pastor's early charge still keeps
its hold upon his heart. It is not to be wondered at
that the few of his flock who yet remain among us
always speak of 'Henry' with beaming eyes and mellowed
voices."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
One expression in this extract will show a peculiarity
which strongly recalls the artless, unconventional
freshness of Western life in those days. The young
pastor, though deeply and truly respected by all his
elders and church members, was always addressed as
"Henry," by them with a sort of family intimacy and
familiarity. It was partly due to the simple, half
woodland habits of the people, and partly to that
quality in the pastor that made every elderly man
love him as a son and every younger one as a brother.</p>

<p>Henry's tastes, enthusiasms, and fancies, his darling
garden, with its prize vegetables and choice roses,
whence came bouquets for the æsthetic, and more
solid presents of prize onions or squashes for the more
literal&mdash;all these seemed to be part and parcel of the
family stock of his church. His brother Charles, who
from intellectual difficulties had abandoned the ministry,
and devoted himself to a musical life as a profession,
inhabited, with his wife and young family, a little
cottage in the same grounds with his own, and shared
his garden labors, and led the music of his church.
"Henry and Charles" were as familiarly spoken of and
known in Indianapolis circles as Castor and Pollux
among the astronomers. In one of the revivals in
Indianapolis, Charles, like his brother before him,
found in an uplift of his moral faculties a tide to carry
him over the sunken rocks of his logic. By his brother's
advice, he took a Bible class, and began the story
of the life of Christ, and the result was that after a
while he saw his way clear to offer himself for ordination,
and was settled in the ministry in Fort Wayne,
Indiana. Thus that simple narrative had power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
allay the speculative doubts of both brothers, and to
give them an opening into the ministry.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher has always looked back with peculiar
tenderness to that Western life, in the glow of his
youthful days, and in that glorious, rich, abundant,
unworn Western country. The West, with its wide,
rich, exuberant spaces of land, its rolling prairies,
garlanded with rainbows of ever-springing flowers,
teeming with abundance of food for man, and opening
in every direction avenues for youthful enterprise and
hope, was to him a morning land. To carry Christ's
spotless banner in high triumph through such a land,
was a thing worth living for, and as he rode on horseback
alone, from day to day, along the rolling prairie
lands, sometimes up to his horse's head in grass and
waving flowers, he felt himself kindled with a sort of
ecstacy. The prairies rolled and blossomed in his
sermons, and his style at this time had a tangled luxuriance
of poetic imagery, a rush and abundance of
words, a sort of rich and heavy involution, that resembled
the growth of a tropical forest.</p>

<p>"What sort of a style <i>am</i> I forming?" he said to a
critical friend, who had come to hear him preach.</p>

<p>"Well, I should call it the 'tropical style,'" was
the reply.</p>

<p>The Western people, simple and strong, shrewd as
Yankees, and excitable and fervent as Southerners,
full of quaint images and peculiar turns of expression
derived from a recent experience of back-woods life,
were an open page in his great book of human nature,
where character revealed itself with an artless
freshness. All the habits of society had an unconventional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
simplicity. People met with the salutation,
"How are ye, stranger?" and had no thought of any
formal law of society, why one human being might
not address another on equal terms, and speak out his
mind on all subjects fully. When invited to supper
at a thrifty farmer's, the supper board was spread in
the best bed-room, the master and mistress stood behind
the chairs of their guests and waited on them
during the meal, and the table groaned with such an
abundance of provision as an eastern imagination
fails to conceive of. Every kind of fowl, choicely
cooked, noble hams, sausages, cheese, bread, butter,
biscuit, corn cakes in every variety, sweet cakes and
confections, preserved fruits of every name, with
steaming tea and coffee, were all indispensable to a
good supper.</p>

<p>Of poverty, properly so called, there was very little.
There were none of those distressing, unsolvable social
problems which perplex the mind and burden the
heart of a pastor in older states of society.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher's ecclesiastical brethren were companions
of whom he never fails to speak with tender respect
and enthusiastic regard. Some of them, like
Father Dickey, were men who approached as near the
apostolic ideal, in poverty, simplicity, childlike sincerity,
and unconquerable, persevering labor, as it is
possible to do. They were all strong, fearless anti-slavery
men, and the resolutions of the Indiana Synod
were always a loud, unsparing and never-failing testimony
against any complicity with slavery in the Presbyterian
church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
As to the great theological controversy that divided
the old and new school church, Mr. Beecher dropped
it at once and forthwith, being in his whole nature
essentially uncontroversial. It came to pass that some
of his warmest personal friends were members of the
Old School church in Indianapolis, and offspring of the
very fiercest combatants who had fought his father in
Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher was on terms of good fellowship with
all denominations. There were in Indianapolis, Baptists,
Methodists, and an Episcopal minister, but he
stood on kindly social terms with all. The spirit of
Western society was liberal, and it was deemed edifying
by the common sense masses that the clergy of different
denominations should meet as equals and brothers.
Mr. Beecher's humorous faculty gave to him a sort of
universal coin which passed current in all sorts of circles,
making every one at ease with him. Human
nature longs to laugh, and a laugh, as Shakspeare
says, "done in the testimony of a good conscience,"
will often do more to bring together wrangling theologians
than a controversy.</p>

<p>There was a store in Indianapolis, where the ministers
of all denominations often dropped in to hear
the news, and where the free western nature made it
always in rule to try each others metal with a joke.
No matter how sharp the joke, it was considered to
be all fair and friendly.</p>

<p>On one occasion, Mr. Beecher, riding to one of the
stations of his mission, was thrown over his horse's
head in crossing the Miami, pitched into the water,
and crept out thoroughly immersed. The incident of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
course furnished occasion for talk in the circles the
next day, and his good friend the Baptist minister
proceeded to attack him the moment he made his
appearance.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho, Beecher, glad to see you! I thought you'd
have to come into our ways at last! You've been immersed
at last; you are as good as any of us now." A
general laugh followed this sally.</p>

<p>"Poh, poh," was the ready response, "my immersion
was a different thing from that of your converts.
You see, I was immersed by a <i>horse</i>, not by an ass."</p>

<p>A chorus of laughter proclaimed that Beecher had
got the better of the joke for this time.</p>

<p>A Methodist brother once said to him, "Well now,
really, Brother Beecher, what have you against Methodist
doctrines?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, only that your converts will practice
them."</p>

<p>"Practice them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you preach falling from grace, and your converts
practice it with a vengeance."</p>

<p>One morning as he was sitting at table, word was
brought in that his friend, the Episcopal minister, was
at the gate, wanting to borrow his horse.</p>

<p>"Stop, stop," said he, with a face of great gravity,
"there's something to be attended to first," and rising
from table, he ran out to him and took his arm with the
air of a man who is about to make a serious proposition.</p>

<p>"Now brother G&mdash;&mdash;, you want my horse for a day?
Well, you see, it lies on my mind greatly that you don't
admit my ordination. I don't think it's fair. Now if
you'll admit that I'm a genuinely ordained minister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
you shall have my horse, but if not, I don't know
about it."</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher took ground from the first that the
pulpit is the place not only for the presentation of
those views which tend to unite man's spiritual nature
directly with God, but also for the consideration of all
those specific reforms which grow out of the doctrine
of Christ in society. He preached openly and boldly
on specific sins prevailing in society, and dangerous
practices which he thought would corrupt or injure.</p>

<p>There was a strong feeling in Indianapolis against
introducing slavery into the discussions of the pulpit.
Some of his principal men had made vehement declarations
that the subject never should be named in
the pulpit of any church with which they were connected.
Mr. Beecher, among his earliest motions in
Synod, however, introduced a resolution that every
minister should preach a thorough exposition and condemnation
of slavery. He fulfilled his part very characteristically,
by preaching three sermons on the life
of Moses, the bondage of the children of Israel under
Pharaoh and their deliverance. Under this cover he
gained the ear of the people, for it has always been
held both orthodox and edifying to bombard the vices
and crimes of old Testament sinners, and to show no
mercy to their iniquities. Before they were aware of
it however, his hearers found themselves listening to a
hot and heavy attack on the existing system of American
slavery, which he exposed in a most thorough,
searching manner, and although the oppressor was
called Pharaoh and the scene was Egypt, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
nobody could find fault with the matter of the discourse,
the end and aim was very manifest.</p>

<p>Nobody was offended, but many were convinced,
and from that time, Mr. Beecher preached Anti-Slavery
sermons in his church just as often as he thought
best, and his church became an efficient bulwark of
the cause.</p>

<p>The Western states at this time were the scenes of
much open vice. Gambling, drinking, licentiousness
were all rife in the community, and against each of
these, Mr. Beecher lifted up his testimony. A course
of sermons on those subjects preached in Indianapolis
and afterwards published under the title of "Lectures
to Young Men," excited in the day of their delivery a
great sensation. The style is that of fervid, almost tropical
fullness, which characterized his Western life. It
differs from the sermons of most clergymen to young
men, in that free and perfect knowledge it shows of all
the details of the evil ways which he names. Mr.
Beecher's peculiar social talent, his convivial powers,
and his habits of close Shaksperian observation, gave
him the key of human nature. Many a gambler or
drunkard, in their better hours were attracted towards
a man who met them as a brother, and seemed to value
and aim for the better parts of their nature. When
Mr. Beecher left Indianapolis some of his most touching
interviews and parting gifts were from men of this
class, whom he had followed in their wanderings and
tried to save. Some he could save and some were too
far in the whirlpool for his arm to pull them out. One
of them said when he heard of his leaving, "Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>
any thing or any body on earth, I do love Beecher.
I know he would have saved me if he could."</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher was so devoted to the West, and so
identified with it, that he never would have left what
he was wont to call his bishopric of Indiana, for the
older and more set and conventional circles of New
York, had not the health of his family made a removal
indispensable.</p>

<p>He was invited to Brooklyn to take charge of a
new enterprise. Plymouth Church was founded by
some fifteen or twenty gentlemen as a new Congregational
Church.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher was to be installed there and had to
pass an examination before Eastern theologians. He
had been, as has been shown, not a bit of a controversialist,
and he had been so busy preaching Christ, and
trying to save sinners, that he was rather rusty in all
the little ins and outs of New England theology. On
many points he was forced to answer "I do not know,"
and sometimes his answer had a whimsical turn that
drew a smile.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in the Perseverance of the Saints?"
said good Dr. Humphrey, his college father, who
thought his son was not doing himself much credit in
the theological line, and hoped to put a question where
he could not fail to answer right.</p>

<p>"I was brought up to believe that doctrine," said
Mr. Beecher, "and I did believe it till I went out West
and saw how Eastern Christians lived when they went
out there. I confess since then I have had my doubts."</p>

<p>On the whole, as Mr. Beecher's record was clear from
the testimony of Western brothers, with whom he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
been in labors more abundant, it was thought not on
the whole dangerous to let him into the eastern sheep-fold.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher immediately announced in Plymouth
Pulpit the same principles that he had in Indianapolis;
namely, his determination to preach Christ among them
not as an absolute system of doctrines, not as a by-gone
historical personage, but as the living Lord and
God, and to bring all the ways and usages of society
to the test of his standards. He announced to all
whom it might concern, that he considered temperance
and anti-slavery a part of the gospel of Christ, and
should preach them accordingly.</p>

<p>During the battle inaugurated by Mr. Webster's
speech of the 7th of March, and the fugitive slave
law, Mr. Beecher labored with his whole soul.</p>

<p>There was, as people will remember, a great Union
Saving Committee at Castle Garden, New York, and
black lists were made out of merchants, who, if they
did not give up their principles, were to be crushed
financially, and many were afraid. Mr. Beecher
preached, and visited from store to store, holding up
the courage of his people to resistance. The advertisement
of Bowen &amp; McNamee that they would "sell
their silks but not their principles," went all through
the country, and as every heroic sentiment does,
brought back an instant response.</p>

<p>At this time Mr. Beecher carried this subject through
New England and New York, in Lyceum lectures, and
began a course of articles in the Independent, under
the star signature, which were widely read. It is said
that when Calhoun was in his last illness, his secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
was reading him extracts from Northern papers, and
among others, one of Mr. Beecher's, entitled "Shall we
compromise?" in which he fully set forth the utter
impossibility of reconciling the two conflicting powers
of freedom and slavery.</p>

<p>"Read that again!" said the old statesman, his eye
lighting up. "That fellow understands his subject; he
has gone to the bottom of it." Calhoun as well as
Garrison understood the utter impossibility of uniting
in one nation two states of society founded on exactly
opposite social principles.</p>

<p>Through all the warfare of principles, Plymouth
Church steadily grew larger. It was an enterprise
dependent for support entirely on the sale of the seats,
and Mr. Beecher was particularly solicitous to make it
understood that the buying of a seat in Plymouth
Church would necessitate the holder to hear the gospel
of Christ unflinchingly applied to the practical
issues of the present hour. Always, as the year came
round, when the renting of the pews approached, Mr.
Beecher took occasion to preach a sermon in which he
swept the whole field of modern reform with particular
reference to every disputed and unpopular doctrine,
and warned all who were thinking of taking their
seats what they must expect for the coming year.</p>

<p>When the battle of the settlement of Kansas was
going on, and the East was sending forth her colonies
as lambs among wolves, Mr. Beecher fearlessly advocated
the necessity of their going out armed, and a
subscription was raised in Plymouth Church to supply
every family with a Bible and a rifle. A great
commotion was then raised and the inconsistency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
such a gift from a professedly Christian church was
much insisted on. Since then, more than one church
in New England has fitted out soldiers and prepared
munitions of war, and more than one clergyman has
preached warlike sermons. The great battle had even
then begun in Kansas. John Brown was our first
great commander, who fought single handed for his
<i>country</i>, when traitors held Washington and used the
United States army only as a means to crush and
persecute her free citizens and help on the slavery conspiracy.
During the war Mr. Beecher's labors were
incessant. Plymouth Church took the charge of raising
and equipping one regiment, the First Long Island,
and many of its young men went out in it. Mr.
Beecher often visited their camp during the time of
their organization and preached to them. His eldest
son was an officer in it, and was afterwards transferred
from it to the artillery service of the regular army.</p>

<p>At this time Mr. Beecher took the editorship of
the Independent, a paper in which he had long been
a contributor. He wished this chance to speak from
time to time his views and opinions to the whole country.
He was in constant communication with Washington
and intimate with the Secretary of War, in
whose patriotism, sagacity and wonderful efficiency he
had the greatest reliance.</p>

<p>The burden of the war upon his spirit, his multiplied
labors in writing, speaking, editorship, and
above all in caring for his country, bore down his
health. His voice began to fail, and he went to Europe
for a temporary respite. On his arrival he was met
on the steamer by parties who wished to make arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
for his speaking in England. He told them
that he had come with no such intention, but wholly
for purposes of relaxation, and that he must entirely
decline speaking in England.</p>

<p>In a private letter to his sister at this time, he said,
"This contest is neither more nor less than the conflict
between democratic and aristocratic institutions,
in which success to one must be defeat to the other.
The aristocratic party in England, see this plainly
enough, and I do not propose to endeavor to pull the
wool over their eyes. I do not expect sympathy from
them. No order yet ever had any sympathy with what
must prove their own downfall. We have got to settle
this question <i>by our armies</i> and the opinions of
mankind will follow."</p>

<p>He spent but a short time in England, enjoying the
hospitality of an American friend and former parishioner,
Mr. C.&nbsp;C. Duncan. After a fortnight spent in
Wales, he went into Switzerland through Northern
Italy and Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher always had side tracks to his mind, on
which his thoughts and interests ran in the intervals
of graver duties. When he came to the life of a city,
and left his beloved garden and the blooming prairies
of the West behind, he began the study of the arts as
a recreation, and prosecuted it, as he did every thing
else, with that enthusiasm which is the parent of industry.
He bought for himself quite an art library, consisting
of all the standard English works on the subject,
and while up and down the country on his anti-slavery
lyceum crusade, usually traveled with some of
these works in his pocket, and read them in the cars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
He also made collections of pictures and choice engravings,
with all the ardor with which before he collected
specimen roses. At intervals he had lectured on these
subjects. His lecture on the Uses of the Beautiful,
was much called for throughout the country. He was
therefore in training to enjoy the art treasures of
Europe.</p>

<p>He had a period of great enjoyment at Berlin, where,
in the Berlin Museum, under the instructions of Waagen
the director of arts, he examined that historical collection,
said to be the richest and most scientifically
arranged series to mark the history of art which can
be found in Europe. The scenery of Switzerland and
the art galleries of Northern Italy also helped to refresh
his mind and divert him from the great national
affliction that weighed on his spirit.</p>

<p>At Paris, he met the news of the battle of Gettysburg
and the taking of Vicksburg, and recognized in
them the only style of argument which could carry
the cause through Europe. Grant was a logician after
his own heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher, on his return to England, was again
solicited to speak in public, and again declined. So
immutable was his idea that this was a battle that
Americans must fight out, and which could not be
talked out.</p>

<p>He was at last, however, made to see his duty to
that small staunch liberal party who had been maintaining
the cause of America against heavy odds in
England, and he felt that if they wished him to speak,
he owed himself to them; that they were brave
defenders hard beset; and that their cause and ours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
was one. Such men as Baptist Noel, Newman Hall,
Francis Newman and others of that class, were applicants
not to be resisted.</p>

<p>He therefore prepared himself for what he always
has felt to have been the greatest effort and severest
labor of his life, to plead the cause of his country at
the bar of the civilized world. A series of engagements
was formed for him to speak in the principal cities of
England and Scotland.</p>

<p>He opened Friday, October 9th, in the Free Trade
Hall, in Manchester, to a crowded audience of 6,000
people. The emissaries of the South had made every
preparation to excite popular tumult, to drown his
voice and prevent his being heard. Here he treated
the subject on its merits, as being the great question
of the rights of working men, and brought out and
exposed the nature of the Southern confederacy as
founded in the right of the superior to oppress the
inferior race. Notwithstanding the roar and fury and
interruptions he persevered and said his say, and
the London Times next day, printed it all with a
column or two of abuse by way of condiment.</p>

<p>October 13th, he spoke in the city hall at Glasgow,
discussing slavery and free labor as comparative systems.
The next day, October 14th, he spoke in Edinburgh
in a great public meeting in the Free Church
Assembly Hall, where he discussed the existing American
conflict from the historical point of view.</p>

<p>This was by far the most quiet and uninterrupted
meeting of any. But the greatest struggle of all was
of course at Liverpool. At Liverpool, where Clarkson
was mobbed, and came near being thrown off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
wharf and drowned, there was still an abundance of
that brutal noisy population which slavery always finds
it useful to stir up to bay and bark when she is
attacked.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher has a firmly knit vigorous physical frame,
come down from back generations of yeomen, renowned
for strength, and it stood him in good service
now. In giving an account afterwards, he said, "I
had to speak extempore on subjects the most delicate
and difficult as between our two nations, where even the
shading of my words was of importance, and yet I
had to outscream a mob and drown the roar of a multitude.
It was like driving a team of runaway horses
and making love to a lady at the same time."</p>

<p>The printed record of this speech, as it came from
England, has constant parentheses of wild uproars,
hootings, howls, cat calls, clamorous denials and interruptions;
but by cheerfulness, perfect fearless good
humor, intense perseverance, and a powerful voice,
Mr. Beecher said all he had to say in spite of the uproar.</p>

<p>Two letters, written about this time, show the state
of his mind during this emergency:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, Oct. 18, 1863. <span class="smcap">London.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>:</p>

<p>You know why I have not written you from
England. I have been so full of work that I could
not. God has been with me and prospered me. I
have had health, and strength, and courage, and what
is of unspeakably more importance, I have had the
sweetest experience of love to God and to man, of all
my life. I have been enabled <i>to love our enemies</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
All the needless ignorance, the party perversions, the
wilful misrepresentations of many newspapers, the
arrogance and obstinacy too often experienced, and
yet more the coolness of brethren of our faith and
order, and the poisoned prejudices that have been
arrayed against me by the propagation of untruths or
distorted reports, have not prevented my having a
love for old England, an appreciation of the good that
is here, and a hearty desire for her whole welfare.
This I count a great blessing. God awakened in
my breast a desire to be a full and true Christian
towards England, the moment I put my foot on her
shores, and he has answered the prayers which he inspired.
I have spoken at Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh,
and Liverpool, and am now in London, preparing
for Exeter Hall, Tuesday next. I have been
buoyant and happy. The streets of Manchester and
Liverpool have been filled with placards, in black and
white letters, full of all lies and bitterness, but they
have seemed to me only the tracery of dreams. For
hours I have striven to speak amid interruptions of
every kind&mdash;yellings, hootings, cat calls, derisive yells,
impertinent and insulting questions, and every conceivable
annoyance&mdash;some personal violence. But
God has kept me in perfect peace. I stood in Liverpool
and looked on the demoniac scene, almost without
a thought that it was <i>me</i> that was present. It
seemed rather like a storm raging in the trees of the
forests, that roared and impeded my progress, but yet
had matters personal or wilful in it, against me. You
know, dear friend, how, when we are lifted by the
inspiration of a great subject, and by the almost visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
presence and vivid sympathy with Christ, the mind
forgets the sediment and dregs of trouble, and sails
serenely in an upper realm of peace, as untouched by
the noise below, as is a bird that flies across a battlefield.
Just so I had at Liverpool and Glasgow, as
sweet an inward peace as ever I did in the loving
meetings of dear old Plymouth Church. And again
and again, when the uproar raged, and I could not
speak, my heart seemed to be taking of the infinite
fullness of the Saviour's pity, and breathing it out upon
those poor, troubled men. I never had so much the
spirit of continuing and unconscious prayer, or rather,
of communion with Christ. I felt that I was his dear
child, and that his arms were about me continually,
and at times that peace that passeth all understanding
has descended upon me that I could not keep tears of
gratitude from falling for so much tender goodness of
my God. For what are outward prosperities compared
with these interior intimacies of God? It is
not the path <i>to</i> the temple, but the <i>interior</i> of the
temple that shows the goodness and glory of God.
And I have been able to commit all to him, myself,
my family, my friends, and in an especial manner the
cause of my country. Oh, my friend, I have felt an
inexpressible wonder that God should give it to me to
do something for the dear land. When sometimes the
idea of being clothed with power to stand up in this
great kingdom, against an inconceivable violence of
prejudice and mistake, and clear the name of my dishonored
country, and let her brow shine forth, crowned
with liberty, glowing with love to man, O, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
seemed unable to live, almost. It almost took my
breath away!</p>

<p>"I have not in a single instance gone to the speaking
halls without all the way breathing to God unutterable
desires for inspiration, guidance, success; and I have
had no disturbance of <i>personality</i>. I have been willing,
yea, with eagerness, to be myself contemptible
in men's sight if only my disgrace might be to the
honor of that cause which is entrusted to our own
thrice dear country. I have asked of God nothing
but this&mdash;and this with uninterrupted heart-flow of
yearning request&mdash;"Make me worthy to speak for God
and man." I never felt my ignorance so painfully,
nor the great want of moral purity and nobility of
soul, as when approaching my tasks of <i>defending liberty</i>
in this her hour of trial. I have an ideal of what
a man should be that labors for such a cause, that
constantly rebukes my real condition, and makes me
feel painfully how little I am. Yet <i>that</i> is hardly
painful. There passes before me a view of God's
glory, so pure, so serene, uplifted, filling the ages, and
more and more to be revealed, that I almost wish to
lose my own identity, to be like a drop of dew that
falls into the sea, and becomes a part of the sublime
whole that glows under every line of latitude, and
sounds on every shore! '<i>That God may be all in all</i>,'&mdash;that
is not a prayer only, but a personal <i>experience</i>.
And in all this time I have not had one unkind feeling
toward a single human being. Even those who are
opposers, I have pitied with undying compassion, and
enemies around me have seemed harmless, and objects
of charity rather than potent foes to be destroyed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
God be thanked, who giveth us the victory through
our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"My dear friend, when I sat down to write, I did it
under this impulse&mdash;that I wanted somebody to know
the secret of my life. I am in a noisy spectacle, and
seem to thousands as one employing merely worldly
implements, and acting under secular motives. But
should I die, on sea or land, I wanted to say to you,
who have been so near and dear to me, that as God's
own very truth, 'the life that I have lived in the flesh,
I have lived by faith of the Son of God.' I wanted
to leave it with some one to say for me that it was not
in natural gifts, nor in great opportunities, nor in personal
ambition, that I have been able to endure and
labor, but that the secret and spring of my outward
life has been an inward, complete, and all-possessing
faith of God's truth, and God's own self working in
me to will and to do of his own good pleasure!</p>

<p>"There, now I feel better!</p>

<p>"Monday, 19th. I do not know as you will understand
the feeling which led to the above outburst. I
had spoken four times in seven days to immense audiences,
under great excitement, and with every effort
of Southern sympathizers, the newspapers, street placards,
and in every other way to prevent my being
heard. I thought I had been through furnaces before,
but this ordeal surpassed all others. I was quite
alone in England. I had no one to consult with. I
felt the burden of having to stand for my country, in
a half hostile land; and yet I never flinched for a moment,
nor lost heart. But after resting twenty weeks,
to begin so suddenly such a tremendous strain upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
my voice, has very much affected it. To-day I am
somewhat fearful I shall be unable to speak to-morrow
night in Exeter Hall. I <i>want</i> to speak there, if the
Lord will only let me. I shall be willing to give up
all the other openings in the kingdom. I cannot stop
to give you any sort of insight into affairs here. One
more good victory, and England will be immovable.
The best <i>thinkers</i> of England will be at any rate.</p>

<p>"I hope my people will feel that I have done my
duty. I know that I have tried. I should be glad to
feel that my countrymen approved, but above all
others I should prize the knowledge that the people
of Plymouth Church were satisfied with me.</p>

"<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>:
</p>

<p>Last night was the culmination of my labor, in
Exeter Hall. It was a very fit close to a series of
meetings that have produced a great sensation in
England. Even an American would be impressed
with the enthusiasm of so much of England as the
people of last night represented for the North. It
was more than willing, than hearty, than even eager,
it was almost wild and fanatical. I was like to have
been killed with people pressing to shake my hand;
men, women, and children crowded up the platform,
and ten and twenty hands held over and stuck through
like so many pronged spears. I was shaken, pinched,
squeezed, in every way an affectionate enthusiasm
could devise, until the police actually came to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
rescue, and forced a way, and dragged me down into
the retiring room, where a like scene began, from
which an inner room gave me refuge, but no relief, for
only with more deliberation, the gentlemen brought
wives, daughters, sons, and selves for a God bless
you! And when Englishmen that had lived in America,
or had sons in our army, or had married American
wives, took me to witness their devotion to our cause,
the chairman of the meeting, Mr. Scott, the Chamberlain
of London, said that a few more meetings, and in
some other parts of England, and the question would
be settled! You will have sent to you abundant accounts,
I presume.</p>

<p>"Lastly; England will be enthusiastically right,
provided we hold on, and <i>gain victories</i>. But England
has an intense and yearning sense of <i>the value
of success</i>.</p>

<p class="sigmiddle">
"Yours, ever lovingly."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Beecher returned from England much exhausted
by the effort. All the strength that he had accumulated
he poured out in that battle.</p>

<p>Events after that swept on rapidly, and not long
after Mr. Beecher, in company with Lloyd Garrison,
and a great party of others, went down to Fort Sumter
to raise again the national flag, when Richmond
had fallen, and the conflict was over. During his stay
at the South, he had some exciting experiences. One
of the most touching was his preaching in one of the
largest churches in South Carolina to a great congregation
of liberated slaves. The sermon, which is in a
recently printed volume of sermons, is full of emotion
and records of thankfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
Returning, he was met by the news of the President's
death, at which, like all the land, he bowed as
a mourner. Not long after, he felt it his duty to strike
another key in his church. The war was over, the
victory won. Mr. Beecher came out with a sermon
on forgiveness of injuries, expounding the present
crisis as a great and rare <span class="smcap smaller">OPPORTUNITY</span>.</p>

<p>The sermon was not a popular one. The community
could not at once change the attitude of war for
that of peace; there were heart-burnings that could
not at once be assuaged. But whatever may be
thought of Mr. Beecher's opinions in the matter of
political policy, there is no doubt that the immediate
and strong impulse to <i>forgive</i>, which came to him at
once when his party was triumphant, was from that
source in his higher nature whence have come all the
best inspirations of his life.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher's views, hopes, wishes, and the policy
he would have wished to have pursued, were very
similar to those of Governor Andrew, and the more
moderate of the republicans, and he did not hesitate
at once to imperil his popularity with his own party,
by the free expression of his opinions. Those who
have been most offended by him cannot but feel that
the man who defied the slaveholder when he was rich,
haughty and powerful, had a right to speak a kind
word for him now when he is poor, and weak, and
defeated. The instinct to defend the weaker side is
strongest in generous natures.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher has met and borne the criticisms of his
own party with that tolerance and equanimity with
which he once bore rebuke for defending the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
the slave. In all the objects sought by the most
radical republicans, he is a firm believer. He holds
to the equal political rights of every human being&mdash;men
and women, the white man and the negro. He
hopes to see this result yet established in the Union,
and if it be attained by means different from those he
counseled, still <i>if it be attained</i>, he will sincerely
rejoice.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Beecher has from time to time entered
largely into politics, yet he has always contemplated
them from the moral and ministerial stand-point. His
public and political labors, though they have been
widely known, are mere offshoots from his steady and
habitual pastoral work in his own parish.</p>

<p>Plymouth Church is to a considerable degree a realization
externally of Mr. Beecher's ideal of what a protestant
church ought to be&mdash;a congregation of faithful
men and women, bound together by a mutual covenant
of Christian love, to apply the principles of Christianity
to society. It has always been <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>, a temperance and
an anti-slavery society. The large revenue raised by
the yearly sale of pews, has come in time to afford a
generous yearly income. This year it amounts to fifty
thousand dollars. This revenue has, besides the pastor's
salary and current expenses, been appropriated
to extinguishing the debt upon the church, which
being at last done, the church will devote its surplus
to missionary operations in its vicinity. Two missions
have been largely supported by the funds derived
from Plymouth Church, and the time and personal
labors of its members. A mechanics' reading-room
is connected with one of these. No church in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
country furnishes a larger body of lay teachers, exhorters,
and missionaries in every department of human
and Christian labor. A large-minded, tolerant, genial
spirit, a cheerful and buoyant style of piety, is characteristic
of the men and women to whose support
and efficient aid in religious works, Mr. Beecher is
largely indebted for his success.</p>

<p>The weekly prayer-meeting of the church is like
the reunion of a large family. The pastor, seated in
the midst, seems only as an elder brother. The various
practical questions of Christian morals are freely
discussed, and every member is invited to express an
opinion.</p>

<p>In one of these meetings, Mr. Beecher gave an autobiographical
account of the growth of his own
mind in religious feeling and opinion, which was taken
down by a reporter. We shall give it as the fitting
close of this sketch.</p>

<p>"If there is any one thing in which I feel that my
own Christian experience has developed more than in
another, I think it is the all-sided use of the love and
worship which I have toward the Lord Jesus Christ.
Every man's mind, that acts for itself, has to go
through its periods of development and evolution.
In the earlier part of my Christian career and ministry,
I had but glimpses of Christ, and was eagerly
seeking to develop in my own mind, and for my people,
a full view of his character, particularly with reference
to the conversion of men; to start them, in
other words, in the Christian life. And for a great
many years I think it was Christ as the wisdom of
God unto salvation that filled my mind very much;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
and I preached Christ <i>as a power</i>, not at all too much,
perhaps, but almost exclusively.</p>

<p>"Well, I think there has been going on in me,
steadily and gradually, a growing <i>appropriation</i> of
Christ to all needs; to every side and phase of experience;
so that at no period of my life was I ever so
conscious of a personal need, so definite, and at so
many points of my nature, as now. I do not know
that I experience such enthusiasm as I have at some
former periods of my life; but I think that at no
other period did I ever have such a sense of the fulness
of God in Christ, or such a sense of the special
point at which this divine all-supply touches the human
want.</p>

<p>"A few points I will mention, that are much in my
mind.</p>

<p>"The love of Christ, as I recollect it in my childhood,
was taught almost entirely from the work of
redemption. That work of redemption was itself a
historical fact, and it was sought to stir up the heart
and the affections by a continual review and iteration
of the great facts of Christ's earthly mission, passion,
atonement and love. I became conscious, very early
in my ministry, that I did not derive&mdash;nor could I see
that Christians generally derived&mdash;from the mere continued
presentation of that circle of facts, a perpetual
help, to anything like the extent that life needs.
There would come to me, as there come to the church,
times in which all these facts seemed to be fused and
kindled, and to afford great light and consolation;
but these were alternative and occasional, whereas the
need was perpetual. And it was not until I went beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
these&mdash;not disdaining them, but using them
rather as a torch, as a means of interpreting Christ in
a higher relation&mdash;that I entered into a train of
thought that revealed to me the intrinsic nature of
God. I had an idea that he loved me on account of
Calvary and Gethsemane, on account of certain historical
facts; but I came, little by little, through glimpses
and occasional appreciations, to that which is now
a continuous, unbroken certainty, namely, a sense of
the <span class="smcap">everlasting need of God, in Christ, to love</span>.
I began to interpret the meaning of love, not by contemplating
a few historical facts, but by running
through my mind human faculties, exalting them, and
imagining them to have infinite scope in the divine
mind. I began to apply our ideas of infinity and
almightiness to the attributes of God, and to form
some conception of what affection must be in a
Being who had created, who had sustained in the
past, and who was to sustain throughout the endless
future, a race of intelligent creatures such as peopled
the earth. In that direction my mind grew, and in
that direction it grows. And from the inward and
everlasting nature of God to love, I have derived
the greatest stimulus, the greatest consolation, and the
greatest comfort in preaching to others. I find many
persons that speak of loving Christ; but it is only
now and then that I meet those who seem to be penetrated
deeply with a consciousness of <span class="smcap">Christ's love
to them</span>, or of its boundlessness, its wealth, its fineness,
its exceeding delicacy, its transcendency in every
line and lineament of possible conception. Once in a
while, people have this view break upon them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span>
meeting, or in some sick hour, or in some revival moment.
That is a blessed visitation which brings to
the soul a realization of the capacity of God to love
imperfect beings with infinite love, and which enables
a man to adapt this truth to his shame-hours, his sorrow-hours,
his love-hours and his selfish hours, and to
find all the time that there is in the revelation of the
love of God in Christ Jesus all-sufficient food for the
soul. It is, indeed, almost to have the gate of heaven
opened to you. The treasure is inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Out of that has grown something besides: for it is
impossible for me to feel that Christ loves me with
such an all-surrounding love, and to feel, as I do every
day of my life, that he has to love me with imperfections,
that he never loves me because I am symmetrical,
never because I am good, never because I deserve
his love, never because I am lovely, but always
because he has the power of loving erring creatures&mdash;it
is impossible for me to feel thus, and not get some
insight into divine charity. Being conscious that he
takes me with all my faults, I cannot but believe that
he takes others with their faults&mdash;Roman Catholics,
Swedenborgians, Unitarians, Universalists, and Christians
of all sects and denominations; and of these, not
only such as are least exceptionable, but such as are
narrow-minded, such as are bigoted, such as are pugnacious,
such as are unlovely. I believe that Christ
finds much in them that he loves, but whether he finds
much in them that he loves or not, he finds much <i>in
himself of capacity to love them</i>. And so I have the
feeling that in all churches, in all denominations, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
is an elect, and Christ sees of the travail of his soul,
and is satisfied.</p>

<p>That is not all. Aside from this catholicity of love of
Christians in all sects and denominations, I have a
sense of <i>ownership</i> in other people. It may seem
rather fanciful, but it has been a source of abiding
comfort to me for many years, that I <i>owned</i> everybody
that was good for anything in life.</p>

<p>I came here, you know, under peculiar circumstances.
I came just at the critical period of the anti-slavery
movement; and I came without such endorsement
as is usually considered necessary in city churches
in the East. Owing to those independent personal
habits that belonged to me, and that I acquired from
my Western training, I never consulted brethren in
the ministry as to what course I should pursue, but
carried on my work as fast and as far as I could according
to the enlightenment of my conscience. For
years, as you will recollect, it excited remark, and
various states of feeling. And so, I felt, always, as
though I was not particularly acceptable to Christians
beyond my own flock, with the exception of single
individuals here and there in other churches. But I
have felt, not resentful, and hardly regretful; for I have
always had a sort of minor under-feeling, that when I
was at home I was strong and all right, though I was
conscious that outside of my own affectionate congregation
I was looked upon with suspicion. This
acting upon a nature proud enough, and sensitive
enough, has wrought a kind of feeling that I never
would intrude upon anybody, and never would ask
any favor of anybody&mdash;as I never have had occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
to do; and I stood very much by myself. But I never
felt any bitterness towards those who regarded me with
disfavor. And I speak the truth, when I declare that
I do not remember to have had towards any minister
a feeling that I would have been afraid to have God
review in the judgment day, and that I do not remember
to have had towards any church or denomination
a feeling that Christ would not approve. On the
other hand, I have had positively and springing from
my sense of the wonderful love with which I am
loved, and with which the whole church is loved, the
feeling that these very men who did not accept me or
my work, were beloved of Christ, and were brethren
to me; and I have said to them mentally, "I am your
brother. <i>You do not know it, but I am, and though
you do not own me, I own you.</i> All that is good in
you is mine, and I am in sympathy with it. And you
cannot keep me out of your church." I belong to
the Presbyterian church. I belong to the Methodist
church. I belong to the Baptist church. I belong
to the Episcopal church. I belong to <i>any</i> church that
has Christ in it. I go where he goes, and love what
he loves. And I insist upon it that though those
churches exclude me, they cannot keep me out. All
those I have reason to believe Christ loves, I <i>claim</i> by
virtue of the love that Christ has for me. Hence, I
have a great sense of richness. I rejoice in everything
that is good in all these denominations, and sorrow
for everything that is bad, or that hinders the work
of Christ in their hands. And I look, and wait, and
long for that day when all Christians shall recognize
each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
I think that people in the church are like persons
riding in a stage at night. For hours they sit side by
side, and shoulder to shoulder, not being able in the
darkness to distinguish one another; but at last, when
day breaks, and they look at each other, behold, they
discover that they are friends and brothers.</p>

<p>So we are riding, I think, through the night of this
earthly state, and do not know that we are brethren,
though we sit shoulder to shoulder; but as the millennial
dawn comes on, we shall find it out and all
will be clear."</p>

the rebel States to their practical relations. In tracing the record
of the actors in the introduction and discussion of these great
measures of legislation, he has given their ideas or quoted their

feelings and opinions. The sketches of these measures, so
comprehensive in their scope and character, cannot fail to be of
interest to the general reader.</p>
